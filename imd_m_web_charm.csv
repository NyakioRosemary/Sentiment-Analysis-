Permalink";"This review is based on Season 1, and I haven't played the video game. The general plot involves a weary middle-aged man and a young girl bonding on a quest in post-apocalyptic America. The first few episodes contain a lot of post-apocalyptic excitement. The first episode showing the world unraveling from a contagious fungus is excellent, and the second episode is almost unbearably tense as the heroes barely evade the horrifying fungal creatures. And then something goes wrong. Perhaps the writers ran out of good filmable source material. In a nine-episode series, there's two entirely superfluous episodes, one involving a love story between two men and a flashback episode involving the girl. Both episodes seem oddly out of place and do nothing to advance the plot. Also, as the pair works their way west into less populated areas, the threat comes from other humans, and the fungal creatures barely seem to be a danger at all.

The two travelers gradually form a quasi-father/daughter relationship, but some of the editorial choices are odd. By far the most compelling character in the show is the older man, well-acted by Pedro Pascal, who feels his age and begins to doubt his competence as the pair makes their way west. But the show focuses more heavily on the young woman who, while she's strong-willed and intelligent, hasn't lived long enough to be all that interesting. Imagine a version of ""True Grit"" where the focus is not on the aging gunfighter but on the girl he's trying to protect.

The show looks good and the early episodes have moments of intense excitement, but there are several easily skippable episodes, and the latter episodes move slowly at times. The ending is a disappointing anti-climax. Overall, if you like this sort of science fiction, I think this is a qualified thumbs up."

Permalink";"It has been a few years since I played the original game but as far as I can tell this show is quite accurate while still adding its own little twists which do not make it differ from the original storyline.

Episode 3 was extremely weird. Yes you already know where this is going. The entire episode feels out of place and more of a filler. It adds nothing to the show and can easily be skipped. The multiple make-out scenes are really in your face and I would assume just make the average person feel uncomfortable. This episode is nothing more than out of place propaganda for the LGBT. But I still must admit that the episode is still very well made and does not drop in quality from the other episodes. It also did start out great until it got well... weird.

The acting in the show was great and the set pieces were amazing. I assume alof of CGI was used but it looked well done and easily fooled me into making it look realistic. You can easily tell that alot of effort went into making this which I can respect.

In conclusion the show is very well made and game accurate. I recommend skipping episode 3 if you don't like old guys making our for multiple scenes and instead just look up the context for the episode online. Episode 3 adds very little to the story. Other than that the show was pretty good."

Permalink";"Review of Season One:

Screen adaptations of video games are always hit and miss, but when I heard all the rave reviews about this one I started believing the hype. I shouldn't have done. On watching THE LAST OF US I felt like I was experiencing yet another run-of-the-mill, generic, hackneyed post-apocalyptic show just like THE WALKING DEAD, in which all of the interesting apocalypse stuff is hurried over in the first episode and everything gets increasingly cliched from there. Season one has only nine episodes and yet two are dull bottle fillers, while the leads are unlikeable, particularly Ramsey's bratty character. When the action hits it's pretty good, but the rest just didn't work too well for me."

It was really something different that actually made a original story that explore areas where the game never did. The direction of the film actually differs from the game but I won't spoil the show. The actors were phenomenal but I'm looking forward to season 2 and what the writers can do that differs from the video game. Even so, this is a show that rather you have played the video game or not, the story line that amyone can easily adapt too. This is a series that is must watch and highly enjoyable."

It shows the role of a father, which is very fashionable these days, and in addition, the relationship between the main characters develops interestingly, which is reframed a couple of times as their common story develops. The series uses the generic topic, ie. Road walked together, while the characters are developing. I. like the way how the trust develops between the main caracters and the flashbacks are adding extra. The whole starts as an average 'walking dead' style plot but as the past of the main chatacters reveals, it allways adds an extra twist ."

Permalink";"I had high hopes for the show, but I ended up with mixed feelings after watching it. The show looks great in terms of how it's made, but there's a big problem - too much bad language, especially from an underage character. This makes it not suitable to watch with family, and I think the people behind the show should have thought more about this. Also, the story and the characters sometimes feel confusing and inconsistent, which made it hard for me to really get into the show. Overall, while the show has some good parts, the excessive swearing and story issues make it a missed opportunity for something better. If you can ignore these problems and just want to see something that looks nice, it might be okay for you. But if you want a show that's good for families and has a strong story, this one falls short. The creators should pay more attention to these things in the future."

Permalink";"Finally, after so many decades, we have a superb movie adaptation of a game.

I played the game for the first time half a year ago, and i love it. Different than the normal shooters, and most important - superbs story, dialogues and well written characters. And this adaptation delivers it almost 100% as the game, with very little changes.

Let's start with that statement. Yes, there are few changed stuff from the game . Most noticable the Bill episode, where .. well it's nothing like the game, and with the all-needed-political homosexual element that it put in every single new movie (nothing agains that, when it fits the script and done well , not just put in your face because they have to have it if they want to win awards). Yes, it's nothing like the game, but it was actually made well. Also the acting there was sooooooo good.... The other changes are much less significant and not that different than the game. I guess the game-version would not have made good episode, as it will feel very ""gaming"".

Besides that, the rest is more or less exactly like the game. Most , if not all of the key moments were put in there, most of the good dialogues, are in there as well.

Acting of both Pedro and Bella is outstanding. While Bella doesn't look like the game character, her personality is spot on. Same goes for Pedro's character. You can't find any real flaw there But we knew that, Pedro already has proven himself as a good actor.

Set and decoration- holy S.... they did outstanding job. Idk how much is CGI and how much is real prop, but it looked like the game for sure. They outdid themselves there.

The only real negative i'd say about this movie, and the reason why i give 8 instead of 10/10 is becuase the action is very minimal. While the game itself is with very little material so it can make you use more stealth and strategy (unlike most other games where you have 1000000bullets so you can kill everything twice...) there's ton of action all around - both with infected and with normal humans. Yes, i know, we have the Walking dead, where you have ton of action ,and this movie accents more on the relationship and the drama of the people (which i actually like and prefer) but... tad more action would have been great.

Lets hope they do Last of us 2 into a season 2... that way they may decide to port the game into PC as well so i can play it lol :D (yep, they did terrible job with optimizing the game for PC but was still playable)"

I have never played the game TLOU, my reviews are the same as someone who has never heard of Cordyceps mushrooms, Ellie or Joel in the game. I feel like too many people flatter this show because they used to play the game. Especially many people are fans of shows about Zombies or Walkers, this show is overrated i'm saying. With the beautifully designed backgrounds, ruined buildings, the streets of the apocalypse... I was quite impressed with the behind-the-scenes production design team, hairdressing makeup... With all these, the characters are boring and wasteful. Some characters are described quite interestingly but in the end they die too quickly and unimpressively. Joel's plot armor is way too strong and makes the show unreal, sometimes I feel like they're introducing the game rather than telling the story in depth. Everything is too predictable, the dialogue is boring, the story line drags on. They should refer to some novel to make Season 2, otherwise this show will become a Clicker, boring, and blind."

Permalink";"Finally a series, or film for that matter, that sticks to the storie that has been told in the game that got it all started.

Teams that work on games are not any less of story tellers than film-makers are, yet their works often get misused by directors that want to make their own story of it and make it all a ""based on the story of..."" mixture (e.g. Resident Evil could've been SO MUCH better).

But to get back to The Last of Us, it's a very well written story, it's got those tense moments and the casting agency did a great job. I found it to be one of the most enjoyable series from the last 5 years.

If you enjoy the zombie-like series/films, you're definitely going to enjoy this one. The quality is right up there with the first 2/3 seasons from the Walking Dead."

I mean if your searching for a lot action you won't find that for the most but there still is. I haven't played the games so I can't really do a comparison but I've heard it was an accurate adaptation. For me I kind of think the show is decent but not amazing. The show has a strong beginning it starts of well and is gripping although the length of the first episode scared me at first it was really good. But then it gets a bit too slow and it wasn't gripping at most of those moments. Though I'm not talking about episode 3, it was beautiful period. Nonetheless the show has great acting by the leads Bella Ramsey and Pedro Pascal and it's well shot. Just got less engaged to it because it was a bit too slow for me. But it's a good show."

Considering there are a thousand zombie/post apocalyptic shows to choose from, one would have to be really good and stick out from the rest to put in the time to watch. Well, The Last of Us is definitely that show. It's not only good, but one of the best zombie/ post apocalyptic shows to some out in the last few years. It seems that most agree based off all the terrific reviews from both critics and the audience alike. It's also been nominated for just about every award possible. The show itself was just nominated for a bunch of Emmy's including best drama, Pedro Pascal was nominated for best lead actor, Bella Ramsey for best lead actress, Nick Offerman, Murray Barnett and Lamar Johnson for best guest actor, Melanie Lynskey, Anna Torv and Storm Reid for best guest actress, best ensemble cast, best directing, best writing, etc. So, as you can see it's a great show. HBO has had so many great shows over the years, too many to even name, and it looks like The Last of Us is the next great one. Already looking forward to next season."

What makes The Last of Us the best video game adaptation is the fact that it is faithful to the source material, but it also makes some improvements. Another reason is that it can be appreciated in the same way by people who never played anything in their lives and people who know everything about the game.

Looking forward to the second season."

Permalink";"I think I am just burnt out with post apocolyptic type movies/shows because after awhile there is nothing really new to bring to the table. All that changes is the characters and the type of bad guy (Zombies, A virus, The Wind etc).

I will say the acting in this is fantastic, there isn't a character that doesn't fit the show. The tension feels real. The characters seem vulnerable. The villain is everywhere so the threat to everyone is always there increasing the tension.

I hadn't played the games but I could tell what was going to happen so by the end of the show the twist didn't seem all that twisty. This was entertaining enough that I would put in time for season 2 but I also wouldn't be disappointed if they didn't make anymore. Still would recommend if you like end of the world type stuff, zombies etc."

However, the great acting and personality of both Pedro and Bella is what makes this show a notable and memorable one. I just really hope, that they don't try to be faithful to the sequel part of the game if season two is planned - if you played that game you would know why - I just want to see them both on some new mission or cause for so many seasons to come.

Permalink";"FIRST SEASON

First three episodes were very good. Next two episodes were almost on the same level. And then, it felt apart.

This is a good drama/horror tv show but it doesn't hold a candle to the first 6-7 seasons of THE WALKING DEAD. Actually, it's more drama than action/horror. It started strong. Story was very interesting. Too many heartbreaking moments because viewers empathize with these characters and care for them. Pascal was amazing all the way, Anna Torv/Offerman were very good. And Bella Ramsey was a pleasant surprise. She had a difficult task, her role was very demanding. And she pulled through.

However, i can't stand anymore Melanie Lynskey in roles like these (see also YELLOWJACKETS). She is a good comedy actress but who in their right mind thought she was a good choice for a post apocalyptic rebellion leader? She doesn't have the physical presence for this.

Of course, she was not the only reason, this went downhill because the story was not so interesting anymore in the last 3-4 episodes. At some point, i didn't care much about the fate of these characters. Intense/action moments were forced and unconvincing. Something felt off. Pedro Pascal's inactiveness was a reason for this. Even him though couldn't save the last episodes. They were boring.

In any case, i am gonna watch the next season. I want to see where it goes."

Permalink";"I've always loved the ""Last Of Us"", I came to find the last of us back in 2019 when I watched YouTube and came across a YouTuber (""Jacksepticeye"") who played ""The Last Of Us Part 2"" ever since then I've followed Naughty Dog by watching YouTube Videos on Part one and Part two going from their bought both video games and of course I bought posters and Funko-pops so of course when I heard they were making a TV Show I just had to watch.

When I saw the trailer when it was first coming out but wasn't able to watch until a couple months later when I turned 18 and was able to get a subscription so, first I read the reviews and all of it sounded promising, expectations were high and I was excited to watch.

When I read the reviews I couldn't find any original fans who loved the video games first so I thought I'd write a review for those who are huge fans of the video game series but aren't sure if they want to see this, due to the chance that this show would ruin the video game series. It doesn't.

The show does go off script a little from the video game script but I'm not in a bad way. They did an awesome job directing and writing and though they went a bit off script it didn't ruin anything in fact I'm almost liking it more than the video game. Prolly the best part about this show is they describe everything sooo much better, they elaborate on so much more then the video game and they did a great job at it too.

The acting was amazing, special effects were awesome, directing and writing was great, it all Exceeded my expectations, I would highly recommend this to any big fans of ""The Last Of Us"""

Permalink";"I've got to be honest - I was disappointed by the video game The Last of Us. I had heard about it for years as one of the great story-oriented games, and was really curious about it. I didn't really care for the gameplay, but the shock was, even though I love games that tell stories, I didn't think this was a great storytelling game.

It did, however, prove to be a genuinely good source for a TV series.

As in the game, bitter Joel must transport weirdly-immune Ellie to scientists to synthesize a cure. These leads to an episodic, brutally grim journey through a wasted America full of terrible zombies and terrible human beings.

This is an unusual zombie series in that sometimes it is barely a zombie series at all, most famously in the Nick Offerman episode (touch though overrated, and not, for me, as good as the later mall episode). Sometimes there are big fights and explosions, but other times there are just these very human stories. And a lot of the series is somewhere in between.

I wouldn't say I love this series, and my god it can be depressing, but it is entertaining and engrossing and well worth watching. Recommended."

As good as it is, ""The Road"" portrayed a post apocalyptic USA a lot better. Based on the graphic novel by Cormack McCarthy, it is a very simple story of a father and son trying to walk across the USA to the SE (Florida?) to seek survival. Along the way they meet diverse elements and remnants of humanity, both good and very bad . The fact that it is based on real science is what intrigued me.

I really like Pedro Pascal (Mandalorian and The Equalizer 2) and he does add a lot to the series TLOU but you should also see ""The Road"" and then you'll see why it is much more intense."

I was hoping that the series was going to have an ending as I couldn't see how this series could be dragged out for another one.

On the positive side there were some parts that resonated with humanity and the need to destroy evil in the world by being more evil, the big let down was that it all ended in a draw."

Permalink";"... and the rest is technically superb, with a cast hitting it out of the park, and everyone behind the camera creating a masterpiece - with one exception. The plot is just not there.

The writing itself is certainly fine, but the overall story is missing. I've been told it was supposed to be about zombies, and when it was, it was great, especially the outbreak in the 1st episode, or the scientist at the start of the 2nd. But from there on out it kind of fades into the background.

I've been told it's about a man learning how to love again, which is weird, because I'm pretty sure he isn't just looking for his brother because he got bored. I also don't think he's with his female companion for her looks.

Does he learn to overcome his loss? Not at all. Is it deep and compelling drama? Well, everyone is miserable, and they stay that way, with the exception of the couple in episode 3, which had a theme, character development and even the newfound ability to love, and that's why it's stuck between the following episodes like a brick in a sandcastle. A great sandcastle, don't touch it, you'll make a lot of people angry, but also... there's not really anything inside.

And then, all of a sudden, you are in a mall for a whole episode, and spent 45 minutes outside of the already shaky plot. The finale, the climax, gets something like 10 minutes. It's a little sad given the talent on display. You gave me so much, why not *everything*?"

Permalink";"Movies/Series and Video Games are entirely different realms, so what works in a game cannot be translated 100% to the screen, as certain aspects are too rooted in gaming. However, ""The Last of Us"" managed to translate the story almost fully while adding some additional elements to enhance the gaming experience, even including nods to the players through visuals and dialogue.

Video game adaptations have generally not been well-received, partially due to creators not fully respecting the original source material and only adapting the most compelling parts without proper build-up. On the other hand, gamers are a challenging audience to please; even if a video game is well-made and captivating, they may still find something to criticize or nitpick, as perfection is hard to achieve.

Character portrayal is another critical aspect when transitioning from game to screen, and ""The Last of Us"" excelled in seamlessly bringing the characters to life, albeit with a slightly different approach. The main leads, Joel (played by Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (played by Bella Ramsey), did an outstanding job embodying their personalities while adding their unique touch. Joel is portrayed with less roughness compared to the game, yet his sense of distrust is evident when facing unfamiliar situations. Through Ellie, he begins to ease up and understands the importance of trust on their journey. Ellie, closer to her game counterpart, expresses heightened emotions throughout the episodes, although some game scenes were omitted either due to time constraints or their incompatibility with the show's narrative, leading to a partial loss of character depth.

Regarding pacing, certain episodes could have been improved by adding a midpoint episode for deeper explanations and another at the finale, possibly extending to two episodes. The ""infected"" were introduced at exactly the right time, and although their portrayal differed from the game, it worked well in the context of the show. However, it might have been more beneficial to maintain them as a continuous focal point throughout the series, as they added an element of dread and uncertainty to each conversation, even in seemingly safe environments.

""The Last of Us"" proves that adaptations can be successful and serve as an entry point for new audiences to fall in love with this universe, while still catering to long-time fans since 2013. The infamous ""video game curse"" has plagued many potential franchise starters, causing them to falter without much consideration. While it may exist for some, others have seen success with adaptations like ""Castlevania"" or ""Arcane"" (based on League of Legends) and more. Let's break free from this curse and create more sophisticated stories based on video games, even if it means altering gameplay mechanics to suit the narrative.

In light of this, most first-party games on the PS4 and now PS5 could be adapted for the big or small screen, as they often resemble long action films in their structure, providing ample potential for adaptation.

Looking ahead, we anticipate upcoming video game adaptations such as ""Fallout"" and ""God of War,"" with more constantly being greenlit. However, it is crucial not to over-saturate the genre and risk it becoming the next Western movie genre fiasco."

The suspense keeps you on the tip of your seat, the acting is done marvelous and creates a vibe that, eventually, materializes. Instead of going downhill, the season just gets better and you start to appreciate the perks of the characters.

The show starts apocalyptic, giving off the sense that all episodes will just revolve around fighting the infected. But this won't happen; the infected just set the stage for an apocalyptic world in which humans are also deprived of their sense of good and wrong. The cinematics are also perfectly done and in line with the beloved game. 10/10 an absolute much watch."

Survivors cluster together in quarantine centres, which are as much a prison run by the fascist government as a safe haven from the infected. People survive any way they know how. Living in Boston is one such survivor, Joel Miller. He helps out the resistance, the Fireflies, whenever there's something in for him. The leader of the local Fireflies offers him an opportunity to find his brother in Wyoming if he helps a teenaged girl, Ellie, get to a Firefly group outside the city. She may hold the key to ending the pandemic.

I was initially sceptical about this series as it seemed like just another zombie drama. Eventually I gave it a watch and I am very glad I did.

It starts interestingly enough, sketching the background and the current state of the world, introducing us to the main characters and a broad indication of the main plot. However, at this point it's still not entirely compelling as it still resembles a plain zombie/survival-odyssey drama.

However, in Episode 3 it kicks into top gear and becomes absolutely riveting. Almost every episode provides a highly engaging character backstory and introduces some very interesting characters. On the subject of characters, the dynamic between Joel and Ellie and how this and their relationship changes is one of the highlights of the series and makes for a great story arc.

The central plot - Joel and Ellie's odyssey - provides the spine to the series and provides the series-wide intrigue. The sub-plots are excellent too while not detracting from the central plot. Quite unpredictable to the point of sometimes teasing you into thinking it is going to follow a clichéd path but then going in a different direction.

Action scenes are fantastic (which you'd hope, as the series is based on a video game).

The only negative is that the final episode feels rushed and goes down a path that is a bit disappointing. The series also seems set up for a second season while I was hoping this would be a mini-series.

Engaging storytelling, great cinematography and good acting. Unfortunately after a good start the following episodes lag quite a bit. Actually found myself zoning out at a couple of them. Also had a bit of an issue with the adaptation from the game. The Ellie character from the game differed substantially from the film. I guess they wanted to ""toughen up"" the character to resound with the public, but it didn't pan out well for me. Casting was done well for the most part, and the supporting cast performed really good. Was sad to see that the ending was a little meh. All in all this is a well made series that you shouldn't miss. I'm just not sure I'll be back for the second season which surely will come."

Permalink";"I had never heard of the video game on which ""The Last of Us"" is based, so I watched the series with an unbiased view. What a show! There have been many productions over the years depicting people trying to survive in a post-apocalyptic world, but this one ups the ante with the types of characters that it has, and the suspense that it creates on every episode.

Now nominated for several Emmys - and with a second season in production - ""The Last of Us"" is one of the many outstanding series that we've seen in the 21st century. This is what happens when the writers have the power instead of the executives.* Definitely see it.

Permalink";"In a world where video game adaptations have often struggled to find their footing on the small screen, The Last of Us stands out as a shining example of how to do it right. The series, based on the beloved video game, has managed to retain the most addictive elements of its source material while weaving a deeper and emotionally charged narrative that stands on its own.

One of the most impressive aspects of The Last of Us is its ability to strike a balance between homage and originality. While some scenes lifted directly from the game may have led to pacing issues for some viewers, the show's departure from the game's narrative has been a breath of fresh air, enriching the story and drawing in both fans and newcomers alike.

The production design deserves applause, as it masterfully recreates the game's environments, making viewers feel like they've stepped right into the post-apocalyptic world. The use of lighting and cinematography adds an extra layer of depth, drawing out the humanity of the characters and creatures in a way that sets it apart from other adaptations.

Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey's performances as Joel and Ellie are nothing short of exceptional. Their chemistry on screen is magnetic, making them irresistibly watchable as they navigate the challenges and dangers of their journey. Pascal's portrayal of Joel has been described as a true embodiment of the character, while Ramsey's portrayal of Ellie has been hailed as a breakout performance, striking a perfect balance between comedy and emotion.

The guest performances in The Last of Us are a true highlight, with a talented cast delivering remarkable portrayals that add richness to the narrative. Each character feels authentic and well-crafted, contributing to the show's overall success.

While the show offers thrilling action sequences, it is during its quieter moments that The Last of Us truly shines. These moments allow the characters to breathe, bringing out the complexities of their personalities and forging powerful emotional connections with the audience.

The Last of Us isn't just a show; it's an experience. With its captivating storytelling, outstanding performances, and stunning production design, it stands as a compelling example of how to adapt a video game into a binge-worthy TV series. Whether you're a fan of the game or a newcomer to this world, The Last of Us is an absolute must-watch."

Dont get me wrong the people were actually really good but i wish it had more of a balance. It sticked really well to the plot and vibe of the original game so im super super thankful about that too. Cant wait for season 2!!! David was also really well played to the point where he actually made you uncomfortable which is good for what he was in a tv show, really gave off the right atmosphere."

I never played the game so I wasn't really sure what to expect going in. I then saw the trailer and read all the great reviews so my expectations rose even more. Well, it not only met those expectations but surpassed them in every way. Pedro Pascal has to be one of the most underrated actors on the planet. He's terrific in everything he's ever done and this is no different. He carries the show again. The rest of the cast is great as well, Bella Ramsey, who play the girl Ellie, has a bright future ahead of her. I can't wait to see where this show goes."

Permalink";"The Last of Us series stands as a remarkable and successful adaptation of a beloved video game into a captivating television show. Pedro Pascal's portrayal of Joel and Bella Ramsey's embodiment of Ellie showcase their exceptional acting abilities, adding depth and authenticity to their characters. The series' visual direction deserves immense praise, with its stunningly crafted locations that transport viewers into the post-apocalyptic world with astonishing realism.

The faithful translation of the game's narrative into a serialized format is commendable. The series captures the essence of the original story and evokes the same emotional impact. The dark and desolate atmosphere of the game is meticulously recreated, immersing the audience in a hauntingly beautiful and treacherous world.

However, as the series reaches its climax, there are slight concerns with the pacing. The plot accelerates rapidly, leaving some crucial moments feeling rushed and lacking the necessary breathing room. This slight loss of momentum compromises the immersive experience that the series excels at establishing.

Nonetheless, The Last of Us series remains a triumph in video game adaptations. Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey deliver standout performances, bringing depth and complexity to their characters. The visually stunning depiction of the game's world adds a visceral layer to the storytelling. While the pacing concerns detract slightly from the overall experience, the series successfully captures the essence of the game and provides an enthralling journey for fans and newcomers alike."

Permalink";"""The Last of Us"" is an unprecedented masterpiece that has taken video game storytelling to new heights. With unparalleled visual and cinematic execution, this series manages to captivate viewers from the very beginning, immersing them in a post-apocalyptic world filled with despair and danger.

The series stands out for its impressive cinematography and direction, perfectly capturing the dark and somber tones of ""The Last of Us"" universe. Each shot is meticulously composed and filled with visual details that reinforce the oppressive and haunting atmosphere of the setting. The desolate landscapes, crumbling buildings, and nature reclaiming its place create a sense of heartbreaking beauty that is simply mesmerizing.

But beyond its stunning visual appeal, ""The Last of Us"" excels in its exceptionally deep and emotionally resonant narrative. The series explores universal themes such as love, loss, redemption, and hope in a world where humanity has been forced to confront its own extinction. The characters, masterfully portrayed by a talented cast, are rich in nuance and complexity, and their interactions and moral dilemmas give rise to gut-wrenching and thought-provoking moments.

Furthermore, the series takes risks by addressing difficult and provocative themes such as the ethics of survival and the limits of empathy in a ruthless environment. It does not shy away from showcasing the darkness inherent in the human condition and the tough decisions characters must make to survive. This creates a constant tension that builds up as the plot progresses, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats, wondering what surprising twist will come next.

""The Last of Us"" is a masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of interactive entertainment. It is a testament to the power of storytelling and the emotional impact that video games can have. Not only is it an outstanding technical achievement, but it is also an experience that will stay etched in the memory of viewers long after they have finished watching it.

In summary, ""The Last of Us"" is a series that deserves to be celebrated as a milestone in audiovisual storytelling. Its stunning combination of breathtaking visual direction, deeply moving narrative, and bold exploration of challenging themes make it an incomparable work of art. If you are a cinephile in search of an emotional and thought-provoking experience, you cannot afford to miss this unparalleled series."

Permalink";"The Last Of Us Season 1 We have Joel and Ellie, Joel a man who is haunted by his past losing his daughter to the apocalypse and doing some presumably disturbing things to stay alive with his brother Tommy that we don't venture in this season ( hopefully we get to see it ), 20 years after the outbreak is tasked with getting Ellie a 14 year old girl who is immune across country to the fireflies so she can be the cure.

The premise is fairly standard but it's the relationships they make with others and especially each other that make the show so drawing. Joel being a stand off character and Ellie being constantly chatty, but under all her hard exterior is just a girl who is scared and seeks comfort.

I am extremely happy with how this show has turned out, it hit almost all the important scenes which really draws the gamer to the screen. The cinematography and the score are absolutely brilliant, the story is beautiful and overall I love it.

It's not all perfect, I feel we needed more infected and action in the show, I know it's not a game but after the first 3 episodes I think we only saw infected maybe twice ? This made the world feel a little too safe, we started off as a horror/drama/survival and that horror element slowly faded away which bumped me a bit because they nailed it, we did get a really strong action scene but bar 1 or 2 that was it and I do think we needed some more of that. I would also put in more action into S2, I want to feel scared for the characters again.

Overall though I had a blast, staying up till 2am every Sunday to see this, maybe S2 comes out at 7 or 8 so I'm not up as late hahahaha I think the entire cast were so perfect especially Joel and Ellie, knowing what happens in the second game and hearing it will take 2 or more seasons to cover makes me excited and I have so much faith in all involved as they have DELIVERED with S1, I loved this adaptation 9/10."

Pedro and Bella shine as Joel and Ellie, capturing the essence of their characters and delivering a chemistry that is both believable and captivating.

The series expertly balances staying true to the original game's plot while incorporating minor but welcome changes that add depth and intrigue. These alterations enhance the story without significantly altering its core, pleasing both fans of the game and newcomers alike.

While the series may have fewer action scenes compared to the game, the ones we do see are nothing short of heart-pounding and dynamic. Each action sequence is meticulously crafted, leaving viewers on the edge of their seats and craving more. The intensity and realism of these scenes are a testament to the exceptional production quality.

In addition to the outstanding performances of Pedro and Bella, the supporting cast delivers a marvelous performance. Each actor brings their A-game, immersing themselves in their respective roles and adding layers of complexity to the narrative. The ensemble cast's chemistry further enhances the authenticity of the world of The Last of Us.

The Last of Us TV series is a remarkable achievement, successfully capturing the essence of the game while adding its own unique touches. Pedro and Bella's performances are nothing short of exceptional, and their chemistry brings the central relationship to life. The minor changes to the story only serve to enhance its impact, while the action scenes are a thrilling spectacle. With a talented supporting cast, this adaptation is a must-watch for fans and newcomers alike."

They really try for the worst situations, really lay it on thick, but it never works that well on a human level. The average episode of Ted Lasso has more pathos than anything in this series.

Then there are the huge logical leaps and continuity errors that would seem out of place even in a bad video game, let alone in a carefully constructed mini series. Skip the really glaring logical misses. Fix the continuity errors. Go for emotions in a more natural way and the show would be close to perfect...

Six out of ten is good, above average, with a few tweaks it would have been an eight or nine."

But it is really just neo Randian rubbish. All forms of society and organisation in the face of a zombie apocalypse are corrupt and dysfunctional and only the true individualist can survive. Well according to the series but not according to actual studies of people in disasters.

There are stupid bottle episodes, very little action, and very little depth in the story. Seriously, I only kept watching this show because people kept saying it was great. It isn't.

During a zombie apocalypse, do the opposite of this show. Cooperate, trade and organise. People are not going to just let corrupt leaders lead, because that will get them killed."

Note: For some reason the best part of the series is the start and it loses its quality little by little whrn it progress but the game's start is the ""least good part"" but progress and getting better 'en better."

In this case, a zombie is a zombie, and a post-apocalyptic landscape is a post-apocalyptic landscape. I've seen nothing new or original in this story.

Permalink";"For years video game adaptations have always been considered to be the worst of the worst but in recent years they have ever so slowly started to get better and better so when I heard Last of Us was getting a show then I just assumed it wouldn't be great. Then, I played the game and absolutely loved it so much that it's now my favorite video game of all time and that got me more excited and I'm glad to say the show surpassed any and all expectations I had for it. It stays true to the game while also being just different enough to make it stand out from the game as well. Pretty much every episode is great or perfect in my opinion. They do an amazing job at fleshing out more of the outside world beyond the main characters which the game doesn't do. It makes the situation seem more real and terrifying. The production design is absolutely incredible. Each set feels very lived in and abandoned. The creators definitely used that massive budget for the show and it really does show. The writing and directing for every episode is top notch and all the performances are incredible too. This is definitely my favorite performance from Pedro Pascal and while I definitely prefer Troy Baker's Joel from the game, Pascal does an incredible job still. Bella Ramsey was perfect as Ellie and was pretty much copy and paste over from the game in performance. The guest actors all did an amazing job as well with Nick Offerman and Murray Bartlett from Episode 3 being some of the best performances ever in a TV show. In fact, Episode 3 is not only the best episode of the show, it's genuinely one of my favorite episodes of a TV show ever. My only real major complaint with the show is that the Riley episode wasn't fully necessary. It's a great episode and the ending is amazing but I feel that episode should have just been intertwined throughout the show instead of getting its own dedicated episode as it does grind the show to a halt. This is easily the best video game adaptation out there and is likely to not be beaten for a very long time. I'd highly recommend this show to anyone who loves the game or just wants some good television."

Permalink";"Let's start with the good. Compelling source material. Classic zombie apocalypse setting. Superb production values. Pedro Pascal, who delivers a compelling and believable performance.

Now the bad. The writing, the writing, and the writing. By far the most tearing-my-own-hair out catastrophe in this whole production is Ellie's dialogue. No teenage girl talks or acts like this. She speaks with the words and cadence of a middle-aged smartass American writer during a cocaine binge, which is of course the person who wrote her lines. But part of basic writing is to write lines that a character would actually say. Her persona is essentially RDJ'd Tony Stark in a teenage girl's body. It's a pathetic, hackneyed, and transparent attempt to give us an uBeR cOoL gIrLbOsS character that we're supposed to love. I doubt many did. Even if the writing was remotely plausible, Bella Ramsay just does not have that sort of charisma.

I'm certain that most people are as bored as I am of this cliche, where they make a child character who is supposed to be precocious or wise beyond her years, but people like that do exist and none of them would ever talk or act like this. It's such a failure on the part of the writer because it breaks your suspended disbelief every time, which could have been avoided.

Unfortunately that's not the only braindead Hollywood cliche that stains this production. We also have the classic 'characters sacrificing themselves for no logical reason whatsoever for a cheap emotional bit', characters who are supposedly survivors but stop and gawp without reacting at all whenever lethal danger comes right at them (so that they can be conveniently saved at the last moment by a cheap plot connivance) and characters running into gunfire to ""save"" other characters who aren't injured and can walk or run perfectly fine.

Overall the plot spends way too much time going nowhere for poor returns in entertainment value.

So yeah. Could have been excellent. Instead is distinctly average."

Permalink";"Pedro Pascal is Joel, a Texan construction worker in his 50s and a semi-outsider in the Boston quarantine zone, where he does grim maintenance jobs and has a sideline in the hidden market. Life is hard and ruthless. Eventually, he meets Ellie (Bella Ramsey, another Game of Thrones expat), a 14-year-old girl whom he must transport west across the ravaged US. She might be the saviour the world has been looking for.

The Last of Us is violent and maudlin. It depicts a world in which people are doing what they can to survive, with varying degrees of horror; at times, encountering the quick-moving, fungus-dangling infected doesn't even seem like the worst thing that could happen. Later in the series, in one terrifying episode, men, not monsters, prove themselves capable of inflicting cruelties that go far beyond the distressing onslaught of zombie attacks."

At one point the best rated show on all of IMDB. I was really excited, waited for all the episodes, put it on in 4k with all bells and whistles. What a letdown.

The show looks great, the special effects, the scenes, the atmosphere, all good. But the show itself uses the most generic dramatic elements that everyone has seen hundreds of times already. They don't apply them in a unique way, either. It's just like watching any other action flick.

Also what's with those NPC conversations? I know it's a videogame adaption, but in many (too many) scenes this show literally feels like a videogame does. The same empty NPC muttering in the background that you hear in a video game when figuring out how to progress to the next checkpoint."

Permalink";"I'm definitely biased when I say that this did not live up to its potential. Far too much is spent on background characters that have little to no impact on the story and not enough time is spent on our 2 main characters. In the game, Joel and Ellie are constantly fighting for their lives against zombies and other humans, having to depend on each other while the world crumbles. Joel is by no means a hero, in the game he kills so many people just to save his surrogate daughter. In the show, there's barely any zombies or people for Joel to kill. You almost forget other people are after them. Where's the danger? Did they put this show on easy mode? Why are we spending 2 or so episodes on side characters, when our main ones have barely bonded? The show should be about them and their bond. If they wanted to explore more of the world, why did they limit the show to 9 episodes?

Very disappointed with the final product, especially when the creator did Chernobyl, which is great."

I think easier was to make just 2h movie, cut all this talk crap moments and then you will have nice game base zomieish movie.

I'm big fan of the game... I don't want to waste much time in this ""8,8"" series so I will pass on the second session.

Big fan of Pedro, like always amazing Bella is so mature and looks much better than in GOT.

Good role for Nick Offerman, thumbs up! Big fan.

Permalink";"""The Last of Us"" HBO series is a true testament to the source material, capturing the essence and emotional depth of the beloved video game with astonishing precision. The show stays faithful to the original narrative, immersing viewers in a post-apocalyptic world filled with desperation and hope. While the initial casting choice of Bella Ramsey as Ellie may have seemed questionable, she defies expectations and makes the role her own, delivering a nuanced performance that resonates.

Pedro Pascal's portrayal of Joel is nothing short of exceptional, showcasing his talent and capturing the character's complexity and moral compass. The chemistry between the two leads is undeniable, bringing their evolving relationship to life on screen.

It is regrettable that ""The Last of Us"" HBO series only consisted of nine episodes, with the third episode feeling somewhat like filler, not pushing the story forward significantly. However, even with this minor setback, the show's remarkable cinematography and immersive world-building make it an absolute must-see.

""The Last of Us"" HBO series captivates with its raw emotions, exceptional performances, and beautifully crafted visuals. Fans of the game will be enthralled by its faithfulness, while newcomers will be drawn into a gripping and haunting tale. Prepare to be immersed in a post-apocalyptic journey that will leave you longing for more."

Permalink";"The history of acquaintance with this amazing story began quite a long time ago. Once I managed to watch a walkthrough of the game in the format of cuts, which made up essentially a whole animated film. Here I will not deal with the analysis of the game itself, because we will talk further about the series, but I will just note that the story of the main characters, the setting of the game and the development of the plot really sunk into my soul. And when I accidentally found out that a serial adaptation of ""The Last of Us"" was being prepared, I was inspired, realizing that I would be able to see a new version of the beloved story on the screen.

The series is an amazing creation that perfectly adapts the game and turns it into an exciting story about survival in a post-apocalyptic world. The main roles were played by Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey, who at first seemed to many (and to me in pritsnip) not very suitable candidates from the point of visual similarity with the game characters. However, as soon as I started watching the first season, all attempts to compare went away. The actors liked the game, and the characters of Joel and Ellie appeared in a slightly modified form, were perceived somewhat differently, but by the middle of the season they became as native as the characters from the game. The actors played their characters at the highest level and conveyed all the emotions and feelings that are inherent in this story.

The series tells about a group of survivors in a world affected by a fungus that turns people into bloodthirsty monsters. The main characters must go through many trials, survive and find that distant place where fate leads them through vast territories.

The story of the game is perfectly conveyed in the series, which allows the viewer to immerse themselves in the world created by the developers. You can see how the whole team tried to convey the atmosphere of the game, beautiful visual solutions were sometimes copied, but at the same time the directors did not abuse this, still showing a separate story. All viewers will be able to understand and get into it, not just those who somehow know the game. The series was created with an eye on the entire audience without the problems often encountered in such projects, where one or another reference, situation, characters will be understood only by those who have played the game before. Therefore, I urge you to boldly watch ""The Last of Us"" for everyone, not just gamers.

There are a lot of characters in the project, which are represented by different actors. The characters are spelled out well, and every actor that meets on the way of Ellie and Joel teaches them and the audience something new and important: to be a good friend even in the society that has developed around, to be able to help even strangers in a difficult situation (although strangers are usually dangerous here), to be able, finally, to love and build a life with your loved ones, although it seems that this is impossible in the current events.

Each episode will be able to show something new and interesting: the relationship between brothers Joel and Tommy, Henry and Sam, the unforgettable love between father Joel and his daughter Sarah, the friendship between Ellie and Riley, Joel and Tess, the love of a couple who have lived together for years, and, it seems, a lifetime, the relationship between groups of people. But of course the most interesting and central story will be the acquaintance of Ellie and Joel, which will turn everyone's life around. These two will distrust each other, learn to live in a single journey, and then completely protect each other from any danger. Each of them has lost too many in this world, and learning to acquire new loved ones is too difficult from a moral point of view. After all, the world of the series is too dangerous, it takes away those you love.

The series is not only an exciting adventure, but also touches on important topics such as family, friendship, love and sacrifice. The main characters go through many trials, but they never lose hope and faith that they will be able to survive in this world. Despite the fact that the story tells about life in a post-apocalypse with peculiar monsters and zombies, the focus of this project is noticeably shifted to the relationship between people. And this is a clear gain against the background of the famous, say, ""The Walking Dead"" by Frank Darabont, who has passed 10 seasons and the good second half of the series focused on endless clashes with armies of zombies. No. This is not entirely bad, but for me personally, ""The Last of Us"" is significantly different from the usual zombie apocalypses. This is exactly the story of people in the world of monsters, not monsters in the world of people.

Excellent directing and high-quality special effects create an atmosphere of reality, which allows the viewer to fully immerse themselves in the world of the series. In addition, the soundtrack, which was created by Gustav Santaolallo, adds additional depth and intensity to the series. Great sound, lingering melodies that evoke a certain sadness and even a sense of nostalgia for the past. According to the past of those people who have been living for two decades in this story after the outbreak of the plague, which depopulated almost the entire planet.

One of the main features of the series is its relevance. The story of survival in a post-apocalyptic world affected by a virus may seem unreal, but it has a deep meaning for our modern society. The series shows that people should be prepared for any challenges that may arise in life, and what is important is to keep hope and faith in the future.

""The Last of Us"" is a strong creation, a series that touches the hearts of viewers. It conveys important emotions, makes you think about life and shows that love and hope can exist in any conditions.

Permalink";"I enjoyed this series thoroughly. The leading actors are great, the story is great and more than anything else the direction and the atmosphere are phenomenal. Many films and series have tried to achieve the effect but very few are at this level of immersion. I have not enjoyed episode three which feels like a rogue afterthought and does not belong to the main story. Everything else is superb. One important thing is that episodes really carry through the story and unlike other series which reserve the interesting part in the initial and final episodes, this one has several high and interesting points that keep you glued to the screen. The infected do not appear in every other corner and this is good because this could well end up as an afterthought of the Walking Dead. What is amazing is the portrayal of human fear, antagonism and danger to each other. All in all, I highly recommend watching this amazing series."

I'll keep it short and simple, the show started well, the first 2 episodes and episode 5 were great and just shows you the potential this series had, i thought it may compete with the walking dead which is was and still the best zombie show ever. Then comes episode 3, spare me the 2 gay characters that didn't add anything to the story whatsoever most of us don't care, same for episode 4,6,7,8 .. same long ass conversation it feels like they are stalling the episode with talking and no action whatsoever. The last episode destroyed any anticipation for the next season as it felt rushed going from scene to scene with no context and just feels all over the place it can make the game of thrones final feel like an emmy winning award episode. All in all, this show doesn't deserve the hype it gets, surely not an 8.8 which is the rating currently, i'd rather rewatch the walking dead instead."

The actors selected in the series were perfectly cast, and the story reflections at the end of each episode make it all the more worthwhile to watch (just like the other Mazin masterpiece Chernobyl).

I finally got what it is about after playing the game many times through and watching the series about 4 times.

It is about being a parent, and all that comes with it. I don't have children because I was too frightened to have them, not because I didn't want them. This series and the game, both showed me how brave parents are, because once that kid pops out, it all really matters."

I find it incredible that in this series, both those who know the game and its story, as well as those who have never had contact with it, can identify with the characters (Joel and Ellie), the world created, the tension of the story, and how well it was directed.

Of course, there were changes from the game that, for those who didn't know it, didn't matter much. For me, the changes fit well in the proposal they wanted to give to certain episodes.

All nine episodes were necessary to adapt the entire first game, without cuts, except of course, for the action parts that are more necessary in a game than in a DRAMA series.

The relationship between Joel and Ellie (also due to the actors) was very well explored and managed to convey the same emotion as the game, between a father and daughter.

NOTE: Great series to watch with parents, yes! Even those who haven't seen the game can be amazed and connected enough to be interested in finishing the series."

Two episodes in and I don't think I can stomach any more of it.

There is no plot to speak of, no coherent storyline. However, the acting and production are good; otherwise I would have rated the show lower. There is nothing that pulls me in to continue watching, nothing to feel good about, nothing hopeful to look forward to.

And apparently the series has already been renewed for a second season. So I guess fans will get more of what they want. I'll take a pass."

I love Pedro and Bella and I think that they are amazing at playing Joel and Ellie, they really made me feel connected to both characters so fast and as they kept getting into dangerous situations I was super worried that something would happen to them. I think that the show does a great job at being different from all the other zombie shows and movies that we already have. They really focus on how much the world and everyone in it would change if this zombie apocalypse were to actually happen, which makes it super freaky to watch. I also love the episodes the focus on the side characters and flashbacks of Ellie."

I really liked the 2nd episode as well but then it just all kinda slammed on the breaks with the exception for the end of episode 5 when the zombies came out of the ground and seeing the deaf kid turn.

Other than that, it just got really slow and felt more like the Walking Dead, another show I didnt care for.

Permalink";"I might be exaggerating a bit with the title, this isn't the first great video game adaptation, although many review sites say it is.

The Last of Us stays true to the game it is based on, but stands on its own as a great show, that viewers unfamiliar with the source material can still enjoy.

The acting in this show is phenomenal, Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey give stellar performances, but the supporting characters can hold their own against the leads.

The story is just as intriguing as the game, and the world building is very well done. It really brings viewers into the world the characters are living in, without having to rely on viewers familiarity with the game.

In some instances, they changed some scenes to differ greatly from the game counterpart, some which worked fine, but others had me scratching my head and wondering why they changed that.

Overall, The Last of Us gives post apocalyptical drama fans a bit of everything, without having to be over reliant on blood and gore to replace gaps in the story. It stays true to the source material, and even includes the exact same soundtrack which, as a video game player, I come to respect greatly from a show!

8/10 - Great

Permalink";"""The Last of Us"" is a video game adaptation that has made its way onto television screens with a bang. The show follows Joel, a tough survivor, who is hired to smuggle Ellie, a 14-year-old girl, out of an oppressive quarantine zone, 20 years after modern civilization has been destroyed. What starts as a small job soon turns into a harrowing journey across the United States, as the duo relies on each other for survival.

The show has only one season with nine episodes, but it has already garnered an impressive score of 8.8 on IMDb. And it's easy to see why. The acting, writing, and production are all top-notch, immersing the viewer in the gritty and dangerous world that Joel and Ellie must navigate.

The dynamic between Joel and Ellie is the heart of the show. The way their relationship develops over the course of their journey is both heartwarming and heart-wrenching, and it's impossible not to become invested in their story.

But ""The Last of Us"" is not just a character-driven drama. It also delivers tense action sequences and moments of intense horror, keeping the viewer on the edge of their seat. The show's use of flashbacks and its exploration of themes such as loss, grief, and morality only add to its depth.

Overall, ""The Last of Us"" is a must-watch for fans of the video game and newcomers alike. It's a masterclass in storytelling and a prime example of how to adapt a beloved property for a new medium. With its outstanding performances, engaging characters, and expertly crafted world-building, I rate ""The Last of Us"" a 9/10."

I can understand the necessity of character development, and using dialogue for world building, but I want to see more mutated humans, not closeups of Bella Ramsey's face for hours on end. The Walking Dead did post-apocalyptic really well, at least initially, but this show is all about the establishment of various settlements, their sets of rules, references to pseudo-governmental entities, rebellions, endless sneaking through apartment buildings and underground tunnels, the forming of alliances, and of course that hoary staple of post-apocalyptic stories, the one person who is immune to the virus. So let's set out for a trip across America for no particular reason and a vague set of directions, and lots and lots and lots of dialogue with some pointless flashbacks crammed in. You'll probably wear out your fast forward button like I did."

It makes you think like what things would be like in a post-apocalyptic world with people, means of survival, precautions, etc. Bring on more!!"

Permalink";"Not too crazy on zombie stuff, and I never played the titular game. Which makes me a true neutral viewer here, and yet the immersion was fast. Good, good.

The first 2 episodes were IMO the best: The pilot in particular, was rich, fast and multilayered in terms of emotions. After that, it becomes more episodic, and deals much more with the various bands of survivors encountered on the journey than the infected themselves, some of which were typical video games contraptions.

The tone is personal as the two main characters slowly unveil themselves to the other, but there are a couple of episodes where they focus elsewhere, both of them with homosexual overtones (which by now are mandatory I suppose). Remove these flashback episodes, plus the pilot which sets the terrain, and that's what, 6 episodes, all of them under an hour?

That's not much but it is enjoyable, for the good dialogues, excellent cinematography and great acting. It isn't an action-packed zombie flick (althought there are some good action scenes here and there), but more like a road movie. I will probably watch again."

Permalink";"The Last of Us, the highly anticipated television adaptation of the beloved video game, is a tense and emotional journey that successfully captures the essence of the original story. The series follows the story of Joel, a grizzled survivor of a zombie apocalypse, and Ellie, a young girl who may hold the key to humanity's survival.

The acting in the series is superb, with Pedro Pascal giving a standout performance as Joel and newcomer Bella Ramsey delivering a captivating portrayal of Ellie. The chemistry between the two leads is palpable and their relationship is at the heart of the show.

Visually, the series is stunning, with a post-apocalyptic world that is both bleak and beautiful. The cinematography and special effects are top-notch, immersing the audience in the world of the show.

While some may be disappointed that the series doesn't follow the game's story beat for beat, it's clear that the creators have put their own unique spin on the material. The changes made are justified and enhance the story, rather than detract from it.

Overall, The Last of Us is a must-watch for fans of the game and newcomers alike. It's a tense and emotional journey that captures the essence of the original story while also standing on its own as a compelling television series."

After being thoroughly underwhelmed by the pilot i watched the rest of it hoping it would get better but to be honest it didn't really , not much happened , it's watchable and ok but just a bit dull and lifeless . To me the plot didn't seem very well thought out and I was left guessing what was supposed to be going on and the lack of depth to the characters kind of made me not fully engage or care. I will probably watch the next season but I'm not going to be all that excited about it's release date."

Permalink";"Finally the tv series for The Last of Us has finally arrived for non gamers. Compared to most modern adaptations from comics to movies or game to shows, the tv series of the Last of Us sticks very closely to its source material with very minute changes. This review will solely be focused on season 1 as season 2 has yet to come out.

Plot/Story: 8.9

Like I previously said, the Last of Us sticks closely to its game counterpart. It expands a bit further on the human side of the world compared to the game such as Riley and Frank and less on the infected though I wish we got to see more. The pacing was pretty good though it could have been managed a bit better on the 2nd half of the season. After the first two eps of the series it did not have the same adrenaline pumping scenes as it had before especially because since we saw less infected. The writing was phenomenal which sticks very closely to its game counterpart and the acting was fantastic. Bella played such an amazing role of Ellie and I was thoroughly impressed on how she can shift her mood and tone so smoothly for such a young actor. The story was well done though it was not perfect there were very minor flaws involved.

Characters: 9.1

The series compared to the game expands quite a bit on the background and lore on the variety of characters that are involved in the series. They were all well written and had their own unique personalities and quirks. Also we could see the development of the relationship between Joel and Ellie from strangers to something of family over time which was so sweet and amazing to see.

Sound: 9.8

Very similar to the game, there isn't much to say. The sound of the infected, the guitar playing, song selections etc.

Visuals: 9.1

It was very well done for the most part such as the CGI and set scenes and costume designs but I think the main focus was the CGI which could be easily seen in certain scenes especially near the end of the season.

Consistency: 8.8

Everything about it was very good on the beginning but fell of slightly near the end especially the CGI and the pacing of the story.

Overall quite an enjoyable series.

Memorable: Yes Rewatchable: Quite Likely..."

When investing into ""The last of Us"" I also went with the same expectations that it will be a waste of time and even though the starting few minutes can feel like a try hard wannabe zombie show but after going through that phase you all will be completely focused on this series don't ask me how this is the only zombie post apocalyptic movie that has more in depth plot and story lines than any other zombie movies were the basic plot is a virus and finding a vaccine this is different in every aspect. As a person who had played both the last of us games I can confirm that they have nailed it and I can't wait for the season 2."

Permalink";"In other words, the television series, just like the original game in 2013, may not reinvent the wheel, but it masters its medium while telling a masterfully crafted story. It's hard to believe that it has been almost 10 years since the (first) game came out. Yet, its story is still as captivating and convincing as it was ten years ago as this series demonstrates. Even more so, it has been enhanced by the television medium, thanks to a number of changes content-wise that I will explain further down below. And no, you're not dreaming when I'm saying that the heart of the original game has not been demolished by the typical disastrous recipe of adapting a game to cinema. Whether the game is better than this series or vice-versa is up for debate, but it's hard not to be convinced of this television adaption of the highly popular game that has now already seen three console generations (and I'm not even talking about further installments down the line)!

What's so good about this series is that you don't even need to know the universe of the game(s) to understand what is going on. Yes, you might not catch some implicit references to the game (pun book anyone?), but the integral story is preserved here. This is unlike many failed game to cinema adaptations before that relied on previous knowledge of the world portrayed. This brings me to another point of why this series is so good: it has been able to successfully make the switch to television. Many game to cinema adaptations suffer from poor storytelling because they simply forget that the action and visuals alone are not enough in a television series. I'm not saying story cannot be important as well in a game, but a television series simply does not have the interactive character of a game which is why its story has to deliver. And in the case, it more than does so.

So what exactly has been done to successfully adapt the game to the big screen? Well, multiple things of course but you might just wonder what the hell all the hype is about? To quickly sum up, The Last of Us follows the journey of Joel and Ellie across the post-apocalyptic landscape of the United States, ravaged by a fungus pandemic that turns people into zombie-like monsters called infected. What seems like a simple smuggling job in the beginning turns out into a long and winding journey through halfway across the country where not even humans are to be trusted. As to be expected, our two main characters eventually learn to rely on each other and develop a special bond that will make the end of the journey a special one. Of course, we meet many more characters and groups of people besides Joel and Ellie and a bunch of raiders and cannibals that are trying to kill them. However, whether good or bad, they all serve (story-wise at least) to explore and accentuate these two contrasting yet complementary characters. While this main storyline only becomes clearer later on in the series and while there are some episodes that seems rather detached from it, it is actually this what makes the entire franchise so strong. No wonder every poster features these two...

Of course, given the series had to bring across this message in fewer amount of hours than the game which doesn't suffer from the implicit rules imposed by the television industry (not saying that the 10-episode structure is bad...), a few sacrifices had to be made. Yes, the series is very faithful to the game, but presenting the exact same plot as the game would have also been kind of lame and to be honest very difficult. The most important change is the fact that a lot of particular sections of the game had to be cut or reworked. The former is rather unproblematic as some parts of the game are far more important story-wise than others, but the latter could be difficult given the attachment that a lot of viewers have with the original game. Whether these changes are better is up for debate, but they don't in any way hinder the quality of the series. On the contrary, they sometimes reinforce it. The Bill and Frank story for example has been completely remade and offers a unique and at times funny and more emotional view of the world that gives the viewer a nice break from the dread and misery encountered in the first few episodes. The reworked Sam and Henry story is another good example where we get more insight into the conflicts between humans that still play a part in this broken down society.

However, this leads me to my second point which is that this does sometimes come at the expense of the presence of our beloved ""infected"", especially in the later episodes. So far some viewers have been disappointed by this change in comparison to the original game where there were plenty of times where we could use our favorite arsenal and combat tricks to kill these zombies. Yet, you have to keep in mind again that the makers had to make decisions regarding the limited screen time they had for bringing over the story of the game. Besides, the absence of infected gives us many original insights into the world of The Last of Us that the game actually could not give due to its more limited perspective of our two main characters. We get to explore groups of people that live by different beliefs. But even more importantly, we get to understand the aggression and power of these infected. Because when they are deployed in the field so to say, some sticks reinforced by scissors and tape simply won't do the trick. This shows us how severe the situation of this world is, but also how fragile our main characters are.

Credit in this regard has to be given to the filmmakers: they really make you fear these types of zombies more than anything else in your life. It is clear that these are the same people that have made the Chernobyl series, because the feeling of dread and freight given to the viewer is again unparalleled. This brings me to what I truly mean with mastering the medium: you don't need to be an expert to know that filming techniques, music, and special effects have been used to perfection to truly make this terrifying world come to life. The Last of Us in general consists of masterfully shot scenes and great make-up and sound effects that gives other upcoming, high-budgeted series a run for their money. This is a far cry from the often poorly produced and made game adaptations for cinema where you wonder if you're not just watching a B-movie with famous actors. And all this is accompanied by great acting all around that not one minute makes you question the believability of the story. The casting was perfect here, as every actor truly makes the story believable here and highly resembles their digital counterpart.

So is there anything negative to say about this supposedly first season of The Last of Us. Well... not much really. Sure, the overall watchability of the series could be improved, with episodes that are more in line with each other in terms of length and tone, but The Last of Us is also special because it doesn't adapt itself to the typical and tired zombie-genre in both games and cinema. It is in the title itself: it is about the people that still live in this wretched world and what they are feeling and doing, not hordes of zombies where we can see all the violence and action we are so accustomed to with this genre. The Last of Us series practically does the impossible by not only staying very close to its original source material which pleases the fans of the game and creates curiosity for those who haven't played it yet, but also by offering new perspectives and insights of the same world that interests both fans and newcomers alike. Forget all those seasons of The Walking Dead and don't wait until Halloween to immerse yourself into scariness: this supposedly first season of The Last of Us on television is some of the finest cinematic content we have seen until now on HBO, a platform which is also by the way known for some of the best television series ever. And all that is coming from a game adaptation..."

Before i start talking about the game

So you're telling that this show is rated 8.9 same as better call saul nah this is a crime because better call saul is miles wayyyyyyyy better than the last of us.

This show was really really good until episode 3 and then it was really really good again until episode 6 to episode 9 everything went downhill the quality of the show and everything being rushed and the final episode in the show is the shortest episode in the show and only being 44m

Now let's talk about the game The game is perfection perfect pacing wayyyyyyyy better acting This suppose to have the same characters as the game

Let's talk about Joel Joel in the game is nowhere near the same as joel in the show Joel in the show is wayy weaker and they showed the soft/human side of him in episode 6 but Pedro Pascal is a good casting for Joel but even though there are better casting for Joel for example Hugh Jackman

Now let's talk about Ellie Bella Ramsey is nowhere Ellie at all bad casting and bad acting and she doesn't look or feel like Ellie at all

Now there are something's that are better in the show

But comparing the game to the show The show is garbage of how good/perfect/goated the game is

If they went with everything of how the game is like literally everything copy paste Then the show would have been wayyy better

I have more things to say but i don't want this review to be longer."

Permalink";"I've played the first game last year so I was somewhat familiar with the plot. I still haven't finished the first game because after few days of playing I just wasn't that into it.

The show itself is not the greatest I've ever watched but that doesn't mean that it wasn't okay or watchable. I think it was trying way too hard to avoid that zombie feel and because of that it lacked in suspension and danger. They ended up turning it into some type of drama series where the only thing that mattered were character's personal feelings.

They had way too many filler episodes and some of the moment where the characters were remembering their past were a bit too long and sometimes even unnecessary (Ellie and Riley at the mall episode). I really didn't like the actress who portrayed Riley. Her performance seemed so dry and that teenage love beetween her and Ellie felt uncomfortable and forced. Also the actresses didn't seem to have any chemistry whatsoever.

But overall this is not a bad show. It had some great emotional moments but it also felt very rushed at times and unexplained. It turns out that the best episode of the show was the first one considered to be a filler one (ep no 3).

I will give this show a solid 7 because anything more than that feels like too much."

First of all, the characters are so well-written that you'll feel like they're your actual friends. Joel and Ellie are the dynamic duo that you never knew you needed in your life. Their banter is on point, and their interactions are just so entertaining. I mean, who wouldn't want to listen to a grown man and a teenager discuss the pros and cons of different types of chocolate bars while fighting off zombies?

Speaking of zombies, they're not your run-of-the-mill undead creatures. These infected monsters are so terrifying that they'll make you jump out of your seat. But don't worry, the action is so intense that you won't have time to be scared for long.

And let's not forget the soundtrack. It's so good that you'll find yourself humming the theme song long after you finish the show. It's the perfect mix of haunting and beautiful.

Overall, The Last of Us Season 1 is a must-watch for anyone who loves great characters, intense action, and zombies. It's the kind of show that will leave you feeling like you just had the best time of your life. Trust me, you won't regret watching it."

The adaptation should have been a limited series with a different ending than the video games to fully adapt it to television, as the finale has no resolution. The conclusion makes sense from a video game perspective, but not for television."

Not deserving of the high 9.0+ ratings it's getting from what I've seen in Season 1.

Honestly, I'd probably rather watch Z-Nation again over this one. But, I'll be here for Season 2 because I enjoy the genre, but I'm not impressed by the show or feel a need to watch them right away. For S02, I plan to wait 'till the entire season is fully released."

Permalink";"""The Last of Us"" has so much good in it: The direction and cinematography, the performances, the production value, the plot - all of it is of an incredibly high quality, higher than one may expect from a seemingly typical post-apocalyptic television series. So what then garners a rating as low as the one I have given? Simply put, ""The Last of Us"" has some of the worst pacing I have ever seen in a mainstream TV show.

God, how I wanted to love this series. There's no denying that Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey are giving their all here - both of them had me openly weeping at various moments due to the sheer emotional resonance of their performances. However, with all the quality and production value both in front of and behind the camera, ""The Last of Us"" suffers from a surprisingly rushed pace. The phrase ""too much but not enough"" comes to mind here, especially considering the amount of flashbacks that this series contains. I mean, two episodes are virtually nothing but flashbacks, and almost every single episode contains a flashback of some sort that grinds the current story to a halt. So, when a flashback isn't occurring, the writers need to catch the story up, leading to a two episode finale where the episodes are the two shortest of the entire show. I mean, what's up with that?

In a show about a proxy father-daughter relationship, it's unfortunate that said relationship takes up as little screen time as it does - Joel and Ellie are the stars of the show, and yet it feels as if they are the ones who are seen the least in the series. And so, when their inevitable bonding occurs, it is unbelievable simply because the show devoted so little time to them. And that, to me, is this show's biggest downfall; I simply didn't believe the relationship between them because the series spends more time in flashbacks and with other characters than with the two people the audience cares most about.

Truth be told, the show spends so much time in the past that it feels like the present is an afterthought; the reason the game series is beloved is because of the father-daughter relationship between Joel and Ellie - the show forgets that for two whole episodes, and ignores it for basically four to five episodes, leading to a climax that, while riveting, is unbelievable due to the lack of proper build up. And that's such a shame, because Pedro and Bella are phenomenal in their roles.

Additionally, for a zombie series, the show barely features any zombies - the first few episodes have all the undead violence you can ask for, but that all gets put on the back-burner for the remaining episodes to focus on the true villains: the people. And while that's a novel idea, it rings hollow, especially during the last episode when it is finally revealed why the Fireflies want Ellie. Let's just say that ""The Walking Dead"" did it better.

""The Last of Us"" has a lot to like, but also leaves a lot to be desired. The production value and overall quality is through the roof, so it's a shame that the pacing is as rushed as it is; two or three more episodes would've worked wonders in building up the relationship between the two titular characters. What we got wasn't bad, per se, but it wasn't nearly as fantastic as it could've been."

Permalink";"If you really want to experience the true greatness that is TLOU 1 then just play the game and then if you must watch this afterwards just for comparisons sake.

The show despite copying a lot of the games story just doesn't do it justice in terms of portraying the emotions and bonding between Joel and Ellie, as much as I like Bella as an actress she just doesn't fit the role of Ellie well, she looks nothing like the game character and despite using some of the same dialogue she cannot convey the same emotional connection and depth as the game character along with the voice of Ashley Johnson. I think Pedro was ok as Joel, he looks a lot more like Joel than Bella does Ellie and even though his acting was fine he is still a far cry from the game character though not as far off as Bella is to Ellie imo.

The show also skips a lot of what makes the game great, the infected for example are few and far between and even though they cannot be used as much as in the game for obvious reasons they are still severely lacking, they change little things here and there for seemingly no reason (another example there are no spores in the show, a big part of how the infection spreads and sticking with bites only which is a big shame if you understand fungus at all)

Overall the show is just mediocre, the acting is ok not great, some of the CGI is good not spectacular, the cinematography is done well though and the set pieces are fine, again all things considered it's just so middling.

So TLDR, just play the first game, it's a masterpiece and this show is anything but."

Season 1 adds 2 episodes that do not appear fully in the game, the weakest of the epidodes ('Long, Long Time' and 'Kin;' acting is great but the stories are weak). The entirety of the series S1 and game Pt 1 are overall depressing from beginning to end with only just one scene of comparative lightness throughout. Watch the series?

Everyone around me said how good is the game (I haven't tried it before) and that probably the show is also going to be great, but for me it was quite meh.

And those memories of the Walking Dead are really fresh in my mind, so the whole topic of the series wasn't quite shocking.

I was expecting something more on the side of production value and plot. Although I was very surprised with the acting of the main characters, it was great, I loved how the chemistry between those two developed thought the season.

I am disappointed in these series, but I still enjoyed it) Now waiting when they are ging to fix the PC port of the game)"

Really leaves you rooting for them till the very end. In the end it tells a story of how we can find what really matters to us even in the most trying times and finding new meaning to life when we least expect. Not so much your classic ""zombie"" flick filled with headshot kills and gut wrenching action( though there's a fair share of those) Real storylines between a vast variety of characters might leave you with a new favourite character after each episode, especially in the first few episodes but not long enough till you have to move on from them."

I went into the show with very little hopes because of my past experiences with movie/show adaptations of video games. However, this was an incredible first season that has me on a hook. The only weak character was Ellie tbh. I think there could've been a better casting choice but I have a feeling that Bella Ramsey will begin to grow on me given time. Pedro Pascal was phenomenal as always. HBO max has some absolute bangers in their arsenal of shows, this is just another one of those. I have a feeling this show will be one of the absolute giants of the next five or so years.

This is not just another walking dead, thank god."

His performance is really similar to Viggo Mortensen's father role in the film ""The Road"". Additionally, the sound and visual effects are very realistic and memorable. If you have played the game, you can see that there is a very well adaptation in every scene of the show. You can really feel the wilderness of the world of ""The Last of Us"". There is nothing more to say except to get ready for an amazing emotional adventure."

The last episode was awful. I think I am in the minority when I say this. But it felt short and rushed and the ending was abysmal. People say the show has a lot of great character building. To me a lot of it just felt like filler. Like the episode 'left behind' it felt like it could have been a 10 minute flashback instead of a whole episode.

But overall a good watch and there is some really special scenes in this show and 2 really good stand out episodes, 1 and 3. I will be watching season 2, with all the shows out I just hope it can hold on to my interest as I did find myself looking at my phone at times. I prefer the walking dead seasons 1-6 as a whole but let's see where the last of us goes next."

Classic walking and talking scenes, discussing how the world used to be etc etc. Action is missing quite a bit while not many twists or turns to the plot.

Bearings in mind that we also have Fear of the Walking Dead series as well then this becomes another post apocalyptic series which to be homest there is nothing new to tell.

Finally if you are into zombie movies I still think that 28 days later is the best of its kind."

Permalink";"The Last of Us is a great show by HBO, based on the acclaimed video game. Although I haven't played the game which made my knowledge about the lore of the game little to nothing, compared to other fans. I did watch the series as a first introduction to ""The Last of Us"". Overall I really enjoyed this first experience.

The Game (and series) focuses on a global pandemic that destroyed humanity, while a survivor takes into his own hands the safety of a girl who may be the key to solve the pandemic.

Creator of the game Neil Druckmann collaborated with Craig Mazin in order to bring this show to life. And together they have created a realistic and somewhat frightening glimpse at what the future may look like.

For Starters: the Cordyceps fungus is a true disease that attacks mostly ants and bugs, controlling their mind, the thought of this fungus adapting and controlling human minds is not that far fetched.

Over the course of Cinema history, there have been many movies and TV shows depicting the end of the world with different reasons: disease, nuclear war, zombies, aliens and so on. The Last of Us is yet another show to introduce the ""post apocalyptic"" world we might be living in someday.

Aside of this show, there was that other movie that depicted a pretty realistic view on the world dealing with a global pandemic - Contagion (2011), highly recommended.

Aside of the overall quality of the series, I will point out that the make-up design is fantastic, the settings and view of the world is scary and visually impressive.

Pedro Pascal is great, one of the best hardworking actors nowadays, plays a good role of a father figure to Ellie (Bella Ramsey). Bella on the other hand, wasn't my main take of the show, nothing wrong with her but Ellie's character wasn't convincing and didn't made me empathize with her. And that says a lot for a character who's supposed to be a main figure in the series.

Joel and Ellie's relationship throughout the show meets ups and downs. I have much to say about their relationship and not in the good way: their relationship is another take on the Léon and Matilda case from Léon the Professional (1994). I swear, ever since that movie, every other father figure - daughter figure type of relationship in a movie or series has been familiar with the Léon and Matilda case. And if you know what I'm talking about than you know that every case ends with the father figure making some heroic sacrifice.

This means, Joel will die in the upcoming seasons, whether you know because you played the game or know because the signs are there.

In conclusion, The Last of Us is great show, it does not fall short. Only it does suffer from repetition over the same elements."

If you want to see character development or hear interesting dialogue, you're in the wrong place. If you didn't play The Last of Us video game, you'll be shaking your head, wondering how anyone could possibly like this drivel.

But if you like clichés, you'll love The Last of Us! And you'll adore it if you like to watch television shows based on video games."

This show isn't about zombies or the end of society! It's literally about boring conversations! You don't even need to watch this show you could literally listen to it on Spotify and get the same boring affect as watching it on TV.

Permalink";"I'm not usually down to review a TV series but when you have something to compare it to (the video game), it makes more sense:

Pedro Pascal did a very impressive job of playing Joel EXACTLY as he is in the game. He was perfect.

Bella Ramsey took Ellie to a different place but it really worked and added even more emotional resonance to the experience. I found Bella's portrayal to be much more childish than Ellie comes off in the game, but it was very charming, and added even more effect when you get towards the end of the story and Ellie has a very noticeable ""shift"".

I had never seen either of these actors in anything before so this was my first impression of both of them and I am definitely a big fan of both of them now.

Though I'm normally a fan of her, Melanie Lynskey was sadly the only character that felt very miscast. She was just not sellable in the specific position of power that she was supposed to be portraying.

I was a bit surprised that the TV series was so much LESS gory than the video game(s). The games are VERY graphic, so much in Part 2 that every single time you ""die"", it never gets less intense or scary. Much of the violence, especially by way of the infected, was left to imagination in the TV series, but I supposed this was probably a decision of taste, in an attempt to allow a wider audience to appreciate this story worth experiencing. Seems like a very Craig Mazin choice - I supposed this was the general vibe of his masterpiece series, Chernobyl as well - very Lovecraftian with its horror - the fear is not in what you see, but what you feel.

Episode 7, based off of the prequel DLC, Left Behind, was even more effective as an episode of TV than the game. By the time you get to that episode, it's really quite incredible. Bella also gives one of her strongest acting performances in this one.

Yes, I cried at all 5 of the final episodes. Multiple times at most of them. I even shed a tear when the girls were simply enjoying a match of Mortal Kombat 2 in the arcade at the abandoned mall, probably because that was the most profound arcade game when it came out when I was a kid. It was literally the coolest thing that existed at the time - it owned my friends and I's psyche. But, there were...much sadder moments than that. Lots of 'em.

A lot of people seemed to have an issue with the final episode, feeling rushed or something. I know it comes suddenly but that's exactly how it happens in the game. I thought it was executed pretty flawlessly. It's a proper ""feel bad"" ending, and that's what The Last Of Us is all about ;-)

Though I do think this story made for a more profound video game than it does a TV series, it was still executed extremely well, paced very well, rounded out nicely, and it is hands down the most impressive video game adaptation that has been made in this history of video games.

I can't wait to see the world react to Part 2 / Season 2. The most intense story ever told in a video game!"

It's when the writers stray from the source material that things start to go downhill sometimes drastically. Most of the added content boils down to poorly executed recycled trope trash that we've already seen in some other apocalypse film.

I really tried to like this version of Ellie and found myself constantly performing mental gymnastics to empathize with her. This proved to be futile because I realized that she's simply a poorly written character. She has no chemistry with Joel and at times, it seemed the writers had to alter his character to force some kind of bond. It felt completely unnatural and never plausible.

Bella Ramsey acted well, especially in episode 8. Pedro Pascal on the other hand was far better in his GOT role. As mentioned before, his lines felt forced in many instances and you can tell he was trying his best to make it work.

In trying to create something new, the writers ended up producing a story that's more of a Frankenstein's monster than the mutated ones portrayed in the show."

This is us is truly 2023's best show, the storyline is amazing, the acting is on point.

At the end of EVERY episode i was like ""OK, this was the best episode"" but it kept getting better and better.

An emotional rollercoaster that will end up with you going to therapy, but it's worth it.

Permalink";"What made the game such a great experience was the relationship between Joel and Ellie. After having watched the first episode I thought the relationship between Joel and Sarah was gripping. And It's that exact chemistry I didn't experience with his relationship with Ellie. Ellie has a more tough character, just like in the game, but lacked to display the more emotional side of her character.

To me that's the main issue this show couldn't lift It to a higher rating, because other than that I though the storytelling and time jumps were quite original. Not just a repeating moment of flashbacks like most series do, but a more intertwined, logical order of telling the stories.

Also, the production of the show, especially the post-apocalyptic world they've created Is off the charts. They also don't rush the storytelling and thought the pace was interesting and almost calming. Which is interesting, considering the theme. It's really more about the people than to scare you.

It's really a solid show that honors the game, just too bad the relationship between Joel and Ellie stays somewhat flat. I think that's the missing ingredient to make It epic. Even the relationship between Bill and Frank, within just one episode, was more immersive.

Looking forward to next season though ;-) It's surely entertaining."

1 some episodes too slow, especially that of the two girls in the mall. I'd have explored other themes (Joel's daughter, Ellie's mother, Ellie's childhood).

2 good avoid another zombie-themed series, but I would have liked a little more action. It seems to be more healthy people (including bandits) than infected but that's not the sense of the story (""the last of us"").

3. The ending is too much similar to the game... they could have dared something different as they did in large part in other episodes."

Pedro and Bella were very good at playing there characters and I feel all casting for the show was perfect. If you have played the games you would know that in some areas it deviates from the games but all changes they make are good and don't ruin the experience at all!

But overall a very good tv show and would highly recommend."

Episode 3 is one I can't get out of my mind. It's a major sidestep of the storyline - it could possibly be a movie on it's own (my girlfriend described it as 'Notebook vibes') - but it sets the mood of this apocalyptic world so incredibly well and it blends back into the main storyline very smoothly.

This post-COVID timing gives an extra perspective what could happen the a world when the s is really on.

I didn't get the feelings of perfection as I did from the game and couldn't relate to the characters and the troubles they're facing.

Would have got higher points if I would have seen this without playing the game but when compared to the game, it was disappointing."

Permalink";"""You come at the king, you best not miss"", a line from HBO's ""The Wire"" was what's repeating in my head while I watched this.

As a TV show in itself, It's not exactly bad. It's probably quite a bit better than usual gruel we get from streaming platforms.

But it went after a bar that's way too high for it. It follows the story of the game pretty closely, even re-enacting memorable scenes down to camera angles, such as when protagonists first saw the overtaken city and such. It changes story here and there, but often it works quite well. I don't mind Sarah being... different. I don't mind re-imagining how things went here or there. I actually quite like little flashbacks/whatever scenes about stuff that builds the story or explains the lore, but wasn't in the game. It's all good.

As long as the core premise holds. But it doesn't. I do buy Pedro Pascal, he looks like Joel, pretty much walks and talks like Joel, and feels right. But Bella Ramsey can't deliver Ellie. And it's not even her fault. Sure, she looks quite... off... and doesn't really come off or feel like a 14-year old (because she's not), but main problem is the aggressive, clueless script she's given.

Story of ""Last of Us"", the game that won uncountable awards, was about a strong man coping with extreme loss, and a scared girl trying to get close to him, while slowly opening up and showing she's pretty capable on her own.

Story of ""Last of US"", the HBO show, I'm not sure. Ellie in this one isn't a scared, suspicious, lonely girl trying to survive. Her very first scenes are full of cursing and gritting of teeth, she's a total badass with zero explanation to this, and goes more aggressive by every episode. The main theme just never comes through. Rather than someone Joel grows to love and care for as his own child, I keep wondering when he's going to dump her in the wilderness.

Or to put it simply, they tried to add girl power where none was needed (because game had more than enough), and totally overdid it, killing the main premise.

Which makes this entire show waste of time, because highly superior medium, telling that story times better, already exists.

Play the game. Skip this show."

They had a good plot given from the game last of us to follow. They of course chose not to follow the plot of the game and instead followed the path of a soap opera. The season consist of a merely 9 episodes and even though they have so little time to span the show on they achieve 3 filler episodes that is completely useless for the plot.

When it comes to zombies there barely is any. We see a lot of montages of abandoned cities and roads. But with a very sterotypical setting where the tall buildings are gray and sliced at the top. Where the cars are all broken down but convenionently always placed at the side of the road so that our main characters can drive through with ease.

Most of the characters are unlikeable especially Ellie that in this show is an arrogant tomboy. Joel is for the majority of the show very dry. Rest of the characters very one dimensional.

The major problem with this show is that is was boring. There didn't really happen anything except a lot of talking, walking and watching.

In several episodes you didn't even get to see any infected/zombies. You didn't even get to see any bodies of infected lying around past episode 2 and there is 9 episodes...

This show was a huge dissapointment. I really didn't think it would be possible for HBO to use so much money for a zombie show that barely contained zombies.

All it consisted of was boring talk between unlikeable characters in and around abandoned buildings."

There was enough in the first episode, just the quality of the production, the strong characters. It seemed deeper and richer than I expected. After all the setup in the first episode, the plot lines just strayed strong and the characters (all powerfully acted, including by some astonishing young actors) just had me totally engaged. There we lots of non-standard, unpredictable, tenuous and tortured relationships. So very 'non-hollywood'. Episode 3 made me laugh and cry. What a triumph. Definitely 'my thing' now."

It is a very hard task to make a a series of episodes where the original story was crafted many years ago and the fans have a good understanding about the sequences.

I myself have been a big fan of the game for many years, but never thought they would make a series of episodes that might surpass better the actual game.

Permalink";"The last scene in the original game did not make me cry, yet it made me stare at the screen and feel hollowness and sorrow. It stuck with me and did not let go. Instead, the finale of the show was more like a sprint in an unknown direction, a retracing of the storyline with the purpose of... repetition. Not adaption.

I have found that the reliance on game material, as in the dialogue, the camera angles, and even the speed at which the words are being pronounced was often too heavy. My favorite episodes were the ones where they concentrated on a specific idea and committed to it (Riley, Sam, Bill). Not everyone has to like these episodes and I understand them as well. It does go in extremity either way. The show either erases the whole plot and makes up a new story or it completely replicates the game without adapting and transforming it fit for television. None of this works.

The pacing being too fast is a direct problem of not adapting the show. While in the game you have an open world to explore and interact with, through which you actually engage with your surroundings and comprehend their meaning, there is no such opportunity in the show. The show, instead, is like a short summary of key points that have happened in TLOU. They did not manage to make up for that interactive part, which, unfortunately, ruined the immersion and did not achieve the very goal of this series being made. That is why the pacing is so fast, and that is also why it feels like we just kept jumping from one idea to the next without forming any meaning around it. It also doesn't help that there is a lack of horror, thrill, suspense that could somewhat diversify the viewer's relationship in consuming the plot. It ends up quite blank, linear, and grounded.

Regarding acting, Pedro was just not embodying Joel. I love the guy, as we all do. However, it is the same issue as the pacing. It's hard to relate and empathize with him when in many episodes he is found non reactionary, silent, and observant. The game makes up for that as you interact with the world and learn Joel's identity through this. Here, you retrace his steps, you aren't emerged into the world or the characters as you simply have no time for that.

As to the directing, it is very lacking. This feels like an amateur cinematography major's second project, not a show produced on a higher budget than Game of Thrones. There were many moments where the choices in cinematography and editing were just confusingly oblivious. These are student-level mistakes that should not be visible in such a big production. Poor directing has often ruined emotional and heavy scenes where it could amplify them and add something new. I know that there were some issues with the cinematography guy whom they had to let go of. Most of the crew here also has very limited experience. Neil himself does not have experience directing a TV show and while the lines between cinema and gaming continue to be blurred, there are still rules and expectations that apply specifically to the world of cinematography. And it is very clear that Neil is just not informed of them as it maintained a quite simplistic approach to shooting throughout. These factors have not done the show justice as they removed the potential of telling the story using the techniques of cinema's language, which could instead make up for some of the pacing issues made.

Lastly, obviously I love the show. Despite its issues, it's still a well done story. It deserves a watch and all the love it receives.

Unfortunately, it is still quite bleak."

Yes I played the game and it was beautifully done, but so much of this show didn't remind me of the game, even though they were fairly faithful in following the storyline of the game. Thought the acting was pretty good, but the entire show was very predictable and boring. Also wanted way more action, less weak character development, and a lot less flashing back and forwards. The 2 occasions they skipped ahead in time were the most interesting parts of the show. Too bad because the first twenty minutes of episode one were the most enjoyable and fairly mediocre from there on out."

There was hardly any on-screen zombies shown at all the entire season run. There's no new ground covered at all either story-wise when it comes to the main characters. All of what we see is already shown during in-game cutscenes that you may as well just play the game.

They treat Ellie like a helpless 5 year old even though she can gun people down on her own. Not surprising since it takes place in America where they're all under the impression that teen girls can't do anything right on their own. 14 year old girls are perfectly fine on their own in other countries and you have to wonder what's America's problem and why they're so absurdly slow to catch on. It's all so very embarrassing for humanity. Screenwriters know nothing about real life. And the makeup artists seemed to be purposefully making Ellie look terrible."

Permalink";"As an avid enjoyer of both video games and film, I was really sceptical when I saw that they had made live action adaption of The Last of Us.

Video game adaptations are notoriously difficult to pull off. The pacing is different, the balancing between shortcuts and the actual game are challenging, and perhaps the hardest thing to accomplish with an adaptation is the immersion that video games provide.

Where others have failed, I feel The Last of Us succeeded. While not living completely up to what was a masterpiece of a game, they did a great job adapting it to television. The whole series has an almost video game-like feel to it. I felt like you could really differentiate between what would have been a cutscene in a game and what would have been a part you actually played. They do a great job drawing out the moment when the main characters face an obstacle, just by a second or two, so it feels like you as the viewer is part of the decision.

That is a part of what makes The Last of Us such a good series. They do not just take out the characters and the core themes, and try to mould them into a television show so they fit TV formula. They lean into the video game roots of it all. If you also add great acting, beautiful cinematography and combine it with an already great story, you get a solid show and a great adaptation.

That being said, the show is not without flaws. My main, and perhaps only, problem is with the pacing. I get that you have to take some shortcuts and leave some things out when you do an adaptation, but you cannot also include two episodes that are essentially filler. The Bill and Frank episode is great on its own, but in a story about Joel and Ellie it feels like a weird decision. Especially when that screen time could have been used Joel and Ellies relationship. This goes double for the episode about Ellies backstory, which feels unnecessary and is the ""worst"" episode in the show.

If they had spent just a little more time on building the relationship between the two main characters, it would have made the final episode just a little bit better. Except that, a fantastic series and without a doubt the best video game adaptation to date."

If I didn't know that the show was based on a game, I stopped watching after the first series, but I forced myself to watch everything to the end so as not to jump to conclusions. Alas.

This passing series will not become a cult. Another drain of an interesting franchise down the toilet. All this is strange to see how much American cinema has been degrading lately."

It offered an amazing pilot episode that set the scene for a relatable time. There are plenty of opportunities to offer up a well paced show. But the introduction of new characters that have only a one episode shelf life doesn't make sense. The show had so much potential but time and time again it simply fell way short of the mark. I am intrigued to see a second season to see if they can offer up better pacing with the writing and get away from all of the character building and get into the main storyline."

Permalink";"The Last Of Us

There are adaptations and then there's The Last Of Us. The post apocalyptic television series holds as the most laudable series of 2023, with its third episode being one of the best episodes in television history.

There's a painstaking amount of attention to its source material, and parts that develop upon or steer away are done masterfully.

The Last Of Us is all about relationships, heart, survival, and it's quiet and sombre moments hit as much if not harder than its grander moments.

The cast is perfect! The chemistry between Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey is palpable, moving and endearing, with the two leads giving career-best performances. Storm Reid, Nick Offerman, Murray Bartlett, and the other numerous guest characters also deliver performances that hold more impact than the solo episodes they star in.

The cinematography is striking and stunning, selling the post apocalyptic landscape. The score, direction, production design and special effects are nothing short of brilliant.

9.5/10."

The story is well known... we have seen it like 1000s of times: apocalyptic world, one survivor has the cure who could save all, but there are lots of obstacles.

Actually this recipe could work fine if the atmosphere would be good. But it's not there. The infected look funny and when they appear on screen. All the ""bad people "" trying to stop our heroes are mediocre, not violent at all, basically just waiting to be killed by the good guys. There are no surprises, dark secrets... the story is linear. The show is overall too colorful, doesn't bring the vibe expected from an apocalyptic series... and even there's the full episode which is about 2 teenagers going around in a mall, having fun at night... Wasting of time.

This is 5 stars at best. I really don't get the hype. If you want to see good apocalyptic series you should look elsewhere."

The necessity to kill, the necessity to love, the necessity to become evil, the necessity to understand the necessity. This show made me think so much.

The show has just upped the Game storyline and characterizations. Raw humanity surviving a hopeless dead world, people unlocking their animalistic behaviours in an inhumane society.

Bill and Frank's episode showed how human instincts like love still exist yet necessity forces them to end it.

People saying ""this show is boring, the people are weak, there aren't any zombies"" don't get the core ideas here. It is how the show is supposed to be. It's about humanity, about the survivors. The undead just emphasize on their stories and instill feeling of insecurity and uncertainty over the whole place.

HBO did a wonderful job here. It was hands down one of the best shows ever written. Strong plot, rough characters, great acting and casting. They did it."

I enjoyed this show far more than I thought I would - given that I have never played the game and am generally not a horror genre fan. However, what I enjoyed most was figuring which scenes were shot in the places I frequent in my home-city of Calgary.

Those who don't care for the horror genre may be pleasantly surprised by how much they enjoy this show. The biggest draw are the fleshed out characters and the ways they react to each other and the world they explore. It is truly a character-driven story with jump scares being few and far in between. That being said, there are some truly unsettling and downright depressing episodes with scenes that are difficult to watch.

It is a good series, but I am concerned that future seasons (if it continues) could easily fall flat in comparison."

Permalink";"The Last of Us (2013) combined the sheer despondency of The Road, the grit of No Country for Old Men, to the somberness of Children of Men. You were held emotionally captive, kept overwhelmed by the seriousness of the tone, in juxtaposition to a medium that we usually assume is dominated by dime-a-dozen ""Shoot 'em ups""; ie: Video Games. The Last of Us took itself seriously: via cinematic cutscenes and movie worthy dialogue: demanding respect from it's audience, which was happily given after an apprehensive launch.

You wouldn't remember/know any of that from watching the HBO show. The sheer bleakness of tone was sacrificed in favor of rushed subplots: subtracting from the audience bonding with Joel and Ellie, and witnessing any natural, progressive, slow bonding between them; for mass appeal. Even HBO's Game of Thrones had to pay ""it's dues"" the first couple seasons; Relying on the good will and interest from eager fans of the novel series, to generate enough interest until casual viewers became interested (from which it then exploded into a phenomenon).

Sicario's Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro) and Kate (Emily Blunt) have more accurate chemistry to The Last of Us's characters Joel and Ellie, than the title characters do in this (inaccurate) rendition. I suggest you watch Sicario, and any of the three inspiration films for The Last of Us, or Logan, if you want true representation of how it should FEEL."

But it has one problem and it is way to short. The main characters take time to flesh out and feel for. And when we do that the series ends. The ending that in the game is just top notch and food for thought does not work as well in the series. The reason for that is very simple. It is the same problem that the game of thrones had in the end.

It just goes way to fast and the dramatic ending do not feel at all as dramatic as in the game. This series should have bin twice as long. When the actors give it all and the enviromnment is this good and it has everything going for it. It is a waste that it just ends when it started."

Permalink";"The Last of Us is a highly anticipated HBO series based on the hit video game of the same name. The showrunners, Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann, have promised to stay true to the game's storyline and characters while also adding new elements to keep fans excited.

After watching the first few episodes, it's clear that they've succeeded in their mission. The show's pacing is spot on, with each episode leaving the audience on the edge of their seats, eagerly waiting for the next one.

The acting is top-notch, with Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey perfectly embodying the roles of Joel and Ellie, respectively. The chemistry between the two is palpable, and their interactions are both heartwarming and heartbreaking.

The show also doesn't shy away from the brutality of the post-apocalyptic world, with scenes that are both violent and emotionally raw. But amidst the darkness, there are moments of hope and humanity that make the show all the more compelling.

As a fan of the game, I was initially worried about how the show would handle certain aspects, but I'm happy to say that they've nailed it. From the infected to the locations, everything feels authentic to the game's world.

One small complaint is that some of the dialogue can feel a bit clunky at times, but it's a minor issue in an otherwise fantastic show.

Overall, The Last of Us HBO series is a must-watch for fans of the game and anyone who loves well-crafted storytelling. It's an emotional rollercoaster that will leave you both satisfied and eagerly anticipating what's to come. Just make sure you have some tissues on hand for the tear-jerking moments.

And for those who haven't played the game, don't worry, you won't feel lost. The show does an excellent job of introducing the world and characters in a way that is accessible to everyone.

In conclusion, The Last of Us is a triumph that proves video game adaptations can be done right. It's a show that will make you laugh, cry, and everything in between. It's so good that it might just make you forget about that terrible Super Mario Bros movie from the '90s."

But the story didn't made whole lot of sense, and everybody just dies in it, often in an unsatisfying random fashion. It is probably good dramatic content for a game, but in a mini series that pretends to be realistic, it got too many plot holes that just downright didn't work and you lose the urgency and emotional bond with it. Other than that, the violence in it was just pointless and unnecessary, it served no purpose other than just to shock the audience. To me the series didn't live up to the hype and it made me even want to play the game even less now."

The only thing that can be praised is a very good production in which a lot of resources have obviously been invested.

The series is full of stereotypes (brave invincible heroes, gay couples, determined women, good marginals, etc.) but is completely unconvincing in the very causes of the disaster as well as the organization of people in the post-apocalyptic time. Some episodes are obviously thrown in just to fill in the gaps as the whole story can be reduced to the journey of the main characters and the relationships between them (often pushed to the point of absurdity in an attempt to be original). None of the main characters arouse sympathy and are often very irritating.

The ending is completely nonsensical and feels like a video game, except that the game probably could have had a smarter ending. Also, no message can be read from the entire series (that was probably not the intention either), but I watched all the episodes and in the end I am convinced that I could have spent my time more wisely."

After all, I've played the first episode of The Last of Us more than once, so the story doesn't surprise me anymore, and more importantly, this isn't a game anymore, so I can't even be entertained by the gameplay. On the one hand though, I'm quite pleased with the finale, because at least there was something extra at times that wasn't in the game, so there's a little something new, but otherwise it's mostly the same. It's hard to say what I think of this series. I'll start with the good stuff. It was really nice to watch. The camera angles, the environmental shots. Nice. I also liked the casting of Joel as Pedro Pascal. Bella Ramsey was cool too, just not as similar in appearance to the cast, but what can you do. Now I'll move on to the worst part, and for me that was the 3rd episode about Bill, which I didn't enjoy and take as unnecessary. Well, the rest of it was great. So I'll just reiterate that it's something I've already experienced in the game and I don't see any reason to show it again especially after the PS5 remake came out, where the graphics are already so hilarious that you get just that movie feel in the cut-scenes. I personally would only recommend The Last of Us series to those who haven't played the game. If you've already played the game, then I don't see it from my perspective to watch the series, which while it showed something new here and there, for me, nothing worth the investment of a few hours of watching. Still, since it was nice to watch and was well made in my opinion, I enjoyed it and thought it was great. However, I repeat that I still don't really see the point in making this series. I could have done without it. I only recommend it to those who haven't played the game."

Overall, in terms of story and subplots, absolutely nothing new here. Its every zombie tale ever told set in another reality and the flashbacks... oh the flashbacks... some were painful to watch not because they were bad but because I just was not invested in the characters and at no point was I curious about their backstories. What I wanted to see was the plot push forward but the show deviated far too often.

So overall id say its a good watch if you are into the whole zombie apocalypse thing like I am. But this is no masterpiece of story telling. It very generic overall. I wish it had a little less of that generic drama and more action."

The characters are played perfectly by their actors and the action and general feel keeps the audience engaged. The main problem that stops this movie from being as good as it can be is the fact that the show was not as engaging as it could be and I was not always excited to watch from week to week due to its tendency to stick to the source material."

The third episode was totally out of the movie lane. Seems like the team really wants an Oscar or another achievement so they just spent full episode in the movie about zombies on some lgbt stuff and it was not just ridiculous but even funny.

Pedro Pascal was on his level no any disputes but I was way more surprised how good was Bella Ramsey. She def has a bright future.

In total we've got very overrated, overhyped, boring and scene by scene OK series, second season of which I am not gonna watch for sure. Have a feeling of wasted time."

Stays true to the game, bar the fillers, but the pace of the game was better. As we've seen many a time, a great game doesn't always make for a great show.

Anyways, I'm not upset I watched it or anything, and it was easy to sit through for the most part. Solid show, not an amazing show, but worth the watch. Especially if you haven't played the game. I feel like the fact that I played the game worked against me."

Permalink";"People say Curse has been lifted for video game adaptations now with Last of Us but I would say there is no need to jump the gun yet. I don't play video games so I can't compare it to the games so I ll only give my opinions of Last of Us as a tv show.

Well it starts of strong, love the chemistry between Joel and Ellie, visually the show looks amazing finally HDR is done right. BGM, costume, set design everything on point. The story has the heart. Violence is handled very well they don't show you the gruesome stuff but they let you know something bad was done. Episode 7 was at best a filler episode which we dont expect from a high profile HBO show. Finale was bit underwhelming it ends abruptly so there is no cliffhanger except you know there are few seasons coming so yeah what's next. One more thing, how did Joel get the strength to kill 3 people after he was injured ? He didn't eat, drink and just had one dose of penicillin some super human stuff or he got an instant medi pack.

Now we need to compare it to The Walking Dead. The first 3 seasons of TWD were pretty darn awesome after it went down hill. In my opinion first season of TWD was better than the first season of The Last of Us. It had the story, the the thrill, the zombies and the characters that you care for. The last of us fell short on the each of the above a wee bit. Sure Joel and Ellie were awesome but this needs to up it's game a bit. It needs to be better than first 3 seasons of TWD atleast to break the curse. Till then it's an 8.5 for me for season 1."

I hope Ellie exists in real word and living her best life. Ellie's character will forever be resonated. Until now I'm still in my emotional state, and I am having this hangover after I finished watching the first season. It's a rollercoaster ride of emotions. I could say this is one of THE BEST game adaptation EVER. PERIOD."

Anyone played the game knows that the game is the greatest of all time. It's so good that they even could take the conversation out of the game in the show.

Even after playing both games it was stunning to watch every scene and leaning some new facts e,g how the virus started to spread and why Ellie is resistant agains the virus.

There is nothing that could be complained by anyone. So any rating below 9 is just from people without any clue of movies or TV shows. Just watch it and enjoy something unique."

Permalink";"""The Last of Us"" is a television series adaptation of the critically acclaimed video game of the same name, developed by Naughty Dog. As a huge fan of the game, I was eager to see how the series would turn out, and I can confidently say that it does not disappoint.

The series follows the story of Joel and Ellie, two survivors of a post-apocalyptic world ravaged by a fungal infection that turns people into zombie-like creatures. The actors chosen to portray these characters are excellent and perfectly embody their roles. Pedro Pascal as Joel and Bella Ramsey as Ellie are particularly noteworthy, delivering standout performances that capture the essence of their characters.

One of the things that impressed me the most about the series is how faithfully it follows the story of the game. The plot is expertly adapted, with the writers managing to capture the emotional depth and nuance that made the game so captivating. The pacing of the series is also spot-on, with each episode leaving me eager for more.

The production values are also top-notch, with impressive cinematography, sound design, and visual effects that help to bring the world of ""The Last of Us"" to life. The series captures the gritty and brutal nature of the game's world while still allowing the characters and their relationships to shine.

Overall, ""The Last of Us"" is a must-watch for fans of the game and newcomers alike. It's a faithful adaptation that stays true to the source material while still standing on its own. With excellent performances, expert storytelling, and impressive production values, the series is a standout in the world of video game adaptations. I can't wait to see what the next season has in store."

However there is 9 hours of peoples relationships with about 5 minutes of infected. This has all been done before in shows like Walking Dead. To me there was at least 2 episodes which were virtually unwatchable. One was an hour dedicated to a gay couple and one where Bella's character showed her and a friends relationship together, not the sort of thing I tuned in for. The series looked cheap with a minimal budget and there was no tension. I'm sorry but I won't be waiting for season 2 in a hurry."

Permalink";"I wasnt sure at first when they announced they would adapt The Last of Us for a TV version because the first game is so beloved but I was going to give it a proper chance anyway. I didnt watch it straight away when the first episode dropped like everyone else, I waited until the full season was available. It's better that way because you can watch everything in one go

It is a great show and faithfully adapted everything from the first game. Although I have some issues with the series one namely being episode 3 because it focused too much on the relationship between Bill and Frank that made the episode boring, the game didnt touch on it too much. But whatever. Also episode 7 which was surprisingly an adaption from Ellie's DLC in the mall with her friend. Most part for episode 7, it still goes the same route with Ellie and her friend at the mall but fails to switch back to the present with Ellie on her own in a different mall gathering supplies and meds to nurse Joel back to full health. Just minor issues for me that doesnt ruin the series for me too much

It's as the title for this review says, it is indeed miles better than The Walking Dead. Game and TV adaption of The Last of Us is more interesting and gripping, the story, Joel and Ellie and of course the zombies. The producers here did a great job recreating the clickers for the TV version as they look exactly like they are in the game

Joel and Ellie? Not much needs to be said other than the fact they are great characters whose actors obviously carry the show from episode to episode. Fun facts for you guys. The actress who plays Ellie's mother in a flashback in the TV series the actress who voices Ellie in the Last of Us games. Also the actress who plays Kathleen is the same one who plays Rose ( Charlie's stalker) in Two and a Half Men

I now need to play the second Last of Us game as I havent played it yet and obviously season 2 will be adapting that game come 2025, luckily for me I still have plenty of time but after watching season 1 it's makes me want to replay the first game first and then go straight to playing the second game."

And giving some of the voice actors like Ashley Johnson and Troy Baker minor roles - feels like a perfect love letter to the game.

There's no way every detail from the game could've been added without new viewers thinking it was too long and boring. And the extra bits they did add felt like they enriched the story rather than take away from the source. Some people will never be happy with a series remake of a game, but this is the best you'll ever get. I just with the fan base for the game wasn't so toxic so they could sit back and appreciate the series like the new viewers do."

Those who came to watch an action zombie series and if any kind of expectation like that still shocked by the world building it provides to the audience, loved the chemistry of characters towards each other. Performance of the cast is amazing and mind boggling. As always Pedro Pascal performance is at top. No wonder people loving it and showing their support for the web series like that. If the term Zombie in a series or movies gives you thought that it would be an action genre then think again."

It's an alright watch but very slow paced and boring at times. Hardly any action which isn't always a necessity but it definitely could have done with some as many of the scenes just put you to sleep

Probably 3 maybe 4 decent episodes at most, not sure how people had been raving so much about it. There's a couple of episodes you dare not complain about or will be called a bigot but they were just pointless episodes if you ask me

When each episode ends it Doesn't leave you excited to see the next episode that's for sure

My girlfriend is a massive fan of the games and she wasn't overly impressed but enjoyed it more than me

I think it's being over hyped because they need it to be a success but it's nowhere near the levels of some of the great series of past like GoT, Stranger things, walking dead before it got bad etc."

Permalink";"Before this show, I still had my doubts with vedeogame adaptations, lately there have been good ones but none of them were great or trascendent, and I was expecting something similar to happen to this show, I thought that since the base story is really solid, they would try to not make a lot of changes and just be safe so that it wasn't a failure, but just after watching the first episode, I knew I was completly wrong and that the people behind the show, was going all in, in trying to make the best show they could make.

I have never played the game but I knew the story and how it went but it still managed to surprise me in almost evry way, the first episode started as good as it could have been. Im not ven sure how to describe this show, it just make me feel excited to see what came next, even I knew Joels daughter was going to die, I still wanted her to survive despite knowing her fate and just having watched for 1 episode, I quickly liked all the characters they introduced despite also knowing their fates, the storytelling, the special effects, the cinematography, everything is very well done, and despite it being almost a copy paste from the videogame on some scnees, it translates awesome on this new format, at the middle of the season it starts to take less and less risks and stops showing us less of what happened before the outbreak and just relies on the source material making it a little slower and a little bit more tedious but only a little, because once you start to watch the episode, you cant stop and it leaves you wanting more. A good show I really liked overall. I cant wait to see the second season and see how they adapt the story from the second game, considering how it was received. I just hope its as good as this first season."

What I got in return was that another post-apocalyptic journey that was artificially extended just to tell a story which basically can be told merely in 2 episodes! I could notice nothing original, nothing untold or not done in the whole season! There are many shows streaming now that are -I'm not exaggerating- at least twice as better than this show. What a disappointment and letdown!"

I am no familiar at all with the game so its my first contact with this characters.

The story is cool but given the high ratings i was expecting way more. It's a bit predictable and i felt the characters were nothing new either. A bit overused the past trauma and self doubting main character bit too.

Effects and all that are good so it's entertaining, you will be able to finish it in a day. The only problem i have with western series now i have become a super fan of asian ones is the structure they have releasing season every 2/3 years. It's actually painful to finish the show with a cliffhanger and by the time they release the next season you won't even remember what was going in previously. I dropped so many series because of this in the past few years.

If this doesn't bother you, you are all good, enjoy!"

Casting should have been done better, for example Kathleen role is total miss with actress, she should not play that role not even in her dreams. Others are ok or below average.

Anyway, the show is watchable if you do not have anything better to do or watch. The pace of action is quite slow and easy predictable, you are constantly waiting to something start happening to justify time invested in watching it but unfortunately it doesn't.

I am not sure why it has 8.9 rating at time of writing this comment, since similar shows are much better, for example The Walking Dead first couple of seasons are way better written and executed."

The sign of a quality series is when you are devastated when it ends & immediately research if there will be another season . No such problems with this one . Gave it 7 for the zombies & the potential ."

Permalink";"I remember playing The Last of Us game long ago and massively enjoyed it. So I wasn't remotely surprised when a TV show adaptation was announced. I was worried as video game adaptions tend to be fairly poor for the most part. Does The Last of Us HBO show fall into the video game adaption curse or does it survive by being a good adaption?

One of the most important elements of adapting a video game is retaining all the core elements that made the game great. In terms of this, the HBO show is successful. The main core of the plot, the characters, the relationship, and the tone are all in this adaptation. The show does make changes from the game but I find the changes to be mostly good. For example, deeper meaning for Joel leaving QZ, exploration of Bill and Frank's backstory, Sam and Henry's plot, and Tommy and Joel's relationship. A lot of the changes give more depth to the characters and the worldbuilding. The set design is terrific and captures the exact feeling of the games. The makeup and design of the infected are creepy as they should be. Every scene with the infected is exciting with the memorable mansion scene being an awesome watch.

In terms of casting, Pedro Pascal is great as Joel. He retains the hardened, spiteful nature of Joel from the games but there are some differences. There is a lot of subtle warmth and vulnerability in his performance which leads to an emotional scene in episode 6 that isn't in the games but has a lot of impact. I was sceptical about Bella Ramsay as Ellie at first. Ellie in the game comes off as naturally witty and sarcastic but Bella's performance can feel a bit forced. It didn't help that her character is written as way more hostile compared to the game. However, I warmed up to her a lot by the end as Bella delivers on the more emotional and heart-warming scenes. Some of the best moments in the show are the quiet moments between Joel and Ellie which is thanks to the great chemistry between Pedro and Bella. The supporting cast does a great job as well with special praise to Nick Offerman as Bill, Lamar Johnson as Henry, Anna Torv as Tess, Merle Dandridge as Marlene and Gabriel Luna as Tommy. The biggest surprise in the supporting cast was seeing the original Joel and Ellie voice actors in substantial supporting roles as new characters where they show how great of an actor, they both are.

Nonetheless, I do have some gripes with this show and one of them is the lack of infected; especially in the second half. For a world that has supposedly been taken by this virus, we don't get enough scenes with the infected. It gets jarringly obvious in the second half where I wondered if they just ran out of budget. In the game, there is a fair amount of downtime between Joel and Ellie after combat. The show doesn't have a lot of these downtime scenes and because of that the relationship between the two doesn't feel as strong and believable. It also disappoints me how rushed the finale was as it was incredibly short with a lot happening. It felt like the show needed an episode where it was just Joel and Ellie spending time together which would've made the finale has more impact. Episode 3 is no doubt one of the more memorable and hopeful episode in this show that is mostly doom and gloom. However, this episode feels like filler in the overall scheme of things. I had a similar issue with episode 7 which was just one entire flashback that was very slow-paced and dragged on for too long. Both of these episodes lacked our main characters interacting which is what this show needed more of.

Overall, this is a good adaptation of the video game. It's not perfect but it does manage to convey the necessary story elements effectively in a TV show format. As someone who has family members who aren't as into video games as me; this TV show is a great way to allow them to experience the story as well. I'm interested to see season 2 of the show. Whether they adapt the sequel or go in a new direction, I'll be there to watch."

Permalink";"So I am guilty of changing my score from 10 to a 9 after finishing the entire first season. I had previously rated the show a 10 after watching the first two episodes as those were quite possibly the best pilot and follow up episodes I've seen since Breaking Bad, The Walking Dead or Ozark. In my mind I always like to think of films as being scored out of 100 rather than 10 and if I had those options I would likely score this between an 85 and 90.

The first couple episodes lived up to the hype and I completely understand why the reviews exploded however after that the show looses some of that momentum which led to people calling it over rated. For a while it was holding steady at a 9.4. And rightfully so, the current score if 8.9 I think suits it much better.

Where things went wrong is that they devoted two full legth episodes to flashbacks which did nothing or very little to progress the story and found themselves playing catch-up in order to tell the whole story in 6 episodes which constituted and entire game. Now, I have not played the game but if you actually add up the runtimes of all the episodes you'll notice that they actually spent a little over 25% - a full quarter of the first season to these two episodes. You don't have to play the game to know that when you waste that much screen time on filler, you're going to be rushing to finish off the story with 75% of a seasons runtime.

Episode 3 has me in a love/hate situation. The episode contained on its own was splendid. The acting could not have been better and it was very interesting to see a preppers take on a post apocalyptic situation. Where things crashed and burned is that it was a complete derailment from the momentum the first two episodes built up and it progressed the story none. I think they should have either kept one of the characters alive to fit them into later parts of the story or added another 15 minutes or so of runtime and released it as a movie sometime between season 1 and 2 in order to fill the very long gap that we're now faced with. This way they would not have left viewers scratching their heads and wondering why they just watched a 76 minute filler episode so early in the season and it would have avoided all the unnecessary debate and flame wars between people who didn't want to see two late-middle aged and hairy men lock beards in a homoerotic love story which takes place in a zombie apocalypse and those who were enthralled in the wokeness of it and praising the show for doing it. I mean the acting and story was good enough for the box offices by far and it it seems like it would have just made so much more sense.

Lastly, I know there was a lot of controversy when Bella Ramsey was cast as Ellie because she has a completely different look about her than the video game version of Ellie. I will say that I can understand people's surprise and hesitance given the totally different demeanours of and types of characters that Bella has played before but also that she did a great job this season. I had no problems with her acting at all and it seems that she has won over more than a few skeptics alike.

Now the first season has Ellie as a young teenager and if the show follows the game, there will be some considerable time that's passed since leaving off in the story and Ellie will have grown into an adult in her 20's and has developed into somewhat of a Lara Croft, Tomb Raider-like character who is as gorgeous as she is lethal and bad ass. Honestly I think I will have a hard time seeing Bella play that type of role as effectively as she played young Ellie. It will certainly be a first for her and legitimate questions about miscasting may come seeping back into the conversation as a result.

So to conclude I would say that it was a little bit over rated and the criticisms of the show were completely valid and skepticism of casting was understandable but overall the season was a great run and has me eagerly awaiting the next. As to what it brings, let's hope that things hold up and we get a good follow up but that the show runners learn from the mistakes made in season 1. Less filler, less rushing and for the love of humanity, MORE ZOMBIES!!!"

The writing is a bit patchy and gets bogged down a bit but has sufficient gravitas in relevant areas to be convincing.

The direction is very patchy. For example, there is some some truly superb direction - such as Peter Hoar's direction in episode 3 (a real masterpiece), and some risible direction - such as Liza Johnson's truly embarrassing effort in episode 7.

The acting, as always, is as good as the direction."

Permalink";"Any episode of The Walking Dead seasons 1 through 5 or Black Summer is better than every single episode of HBO's The Last of Us.

The series brings nothing new and what it does bring is less less than. Less fear and less drama. I say drama because there is no chemistry between the older male lead and the younger girl. None.. no chemistry whatsoever. In fact they would have been better off having them as enemies the entire show . Because of the limited amount of cast members you are stuck looking at our heroin constantly and her face nearly in every scene for overly long exposures. And that was difficult even for a horror series. No offense, she is odd looking and she is difficult to look at. Difficult to look at and unable to express her feelings through mannerisms or facial expressions. She is simply not heavy enough to be a lead. She is a secondary character actress and the friend of a friend.

I challenge anyone here watch one episode of Black Summer and any episode of The Walking Dead seasons 1 through 5 and you will see how everyone of those episodes are superior to ANY episode off The Last of Us presented at any time."

Permalink";"Even though I knew the original story from the game, I was pleasantly surprised by its adaptation and changes, realizing what moments were removed and/or replaced. I found both positives and negatives in it. But let's move in order relative to Season 1, superficially without spoilers and having a reference of the original game.

The original atmosphere of the game is fully preserved. Changes harmoniously transition into each other, and some even better reveal the original (video game) story! All the tedious moments from the game to the series - removed, which is always wanted to do in some moments. Though the secondary characters are visually slightly different from the original characters, but this does not affect the viewing experience at all. The standard of quality of the series from HBO Max is pleasing.

As for the negatives, that is: First of all, the actress that Ellie plays, sorry to say, is not right for me. She, though well acted, lacks that lamplight empathy and affection for the character. The actor playing Joel is good, but I would have considered other candidates, as it feels a certain amount of wrong from the original character.

Secondly, there were some fairly important moments left out (I counted about a dozen of them!!!) that should have been left out, but they were unfortunately removed or otherwise changed for the worse, giving less effect while watching. Without some, again, moments, the scenes that await us (hopefully) in season two won't be as meaningful, and that's unfortunate for people who don't have the original experience.

Thirdly, although the overall opinion of the series is that it was implemented normally, there is a feeling of lost original nuances and different directing. It's like they took away different significant plot points and made a different approach to directing that was originally better in the video game. This series does not convey that depth of drama, does not form those special viewer feelings for the main characters.

The series will not disappoint fans of one of the best story-driven video games in general. It has various flaws, but there are positives as well, although it could have been made even better. It seems to me that even though the series runs an average of 50 minutes, which is the norm for series, but here they should have given more time to unfold the plot, as they did in episode 3 with a canonical change."

Because the series is actually a series of short films of very different quality. The whole thing starts off really strong and falls deep. This is mainly due to the fact that the series does not have its own core, but unfortunately uses too many well-known films and books. I can only take a few from the series, which makes it really stand-alone. The end time scenario with a virus overshadowing the world that you have told many times. In addition, the series keeps getting lost in very long monologues. You don't get the long-awaited action here. Little action, lots of talking."

Permalink";"It looked like this would be an amazing series, but Druckman's choices resemble what happened with TLOU2. Focus on the main story got constantly interrupted by throwing flashbacks and new characters with their storylines in. When done well, this can work, however done it the way Neil is doing, creates more of a disservice to how amazing story could've been. I said it all the time and I said it again: for such a short TV series you inject 3 filler episodes (which on their own were actually pretty good, well...at least 2 of them), not leaving enough space to properly tell main story (which everyone's here for), rushing it and skipping important facts, that should not be omitted. Why? Instead of potential 9 or even 10 out of 10, we end up with somewhat mediocre series with lost potential. I bet if those fillers could be released as a separate thing, part of something like ""TLOU: Stories"", fans would love to watch extended universe tales. But no, instead Druckmania takes over and again it is more about what he wants, rather than what we all wanted to see, because from episode 1 we were hooked...and then he slowly started loosing us. So that...world being shown in a way that is not really that bad, that more of a problem are people, rather than the virus itself and life ain't that bad, therefore Ellie's sacrifice is not really that important. Plus this story being thrown around all over the place, not having proper focus, being interrupted. Game was there, all they needed to do is make a proper adaptation of it and it would've end up as a hit, making tons of dough...but no, modern Hollywood has their own thing going on, nevermind the fans. Well...you know what Buckaroo? Those fans pay to see something they can appreciate...and if they cannot get that from you, they will stop paying and go someplace else."

Permalink";"The whole point of the story is the bonding of Joel and Ellie, but that never happens. As a result, major parts of the story have no impact. Worse yet, Ellie is unlikeable and seems to suffer from a brain disease that turns off the part of her brain that feels fear. Whether she's about to be eaten or being shot at, you can count on her showing little to no emotion at all.

Joel is a pushover and is constantly being controlled by Ellie. The show tries to cram in the scene of him demanding that she follow his orders, but that never actualizes into action. Only in the very last episode does Ellie seem to become human, and acts like someone of her age and sex would do in that situation. In all the previous episodes she is clearly as fictional character. Exhibiting behavior and emotions that are completely at odds with what a real life equivalent would do.

The cinematography ranges from bad to ok. They decided to go the handheld route, where every static shot has an irritating amount of handheld shake. Why did they do that? Maybe god knows. There's also an overabundant use of wide angle lenses, and also wide angle shots to show the world around them. This sounds like a good thing in theory, but there's a reason why tighter focal lengths are usually used in film. In this case focusing too much on the background made it lose its magic. Seeing cities covered in grass is interesting for a few seconds and then it loses its appeal. In a show like this you're supposed to use a wide angle shot at the very start of a scene, to give context to the surroundings, and then use tighter angles that focus on the characters.

The show has two pointless filler episodes that add nothing to the story and only exist to fulfill Neil Druckmann's need to virtue signal. Episode 3 and 7. The episodes aren't just pointless and boring, but they also take away screen time that could have been spent on creating a relationship between Joel and Ellie.

There is a severe lack of zombies in this zombie apocalypse (Cordyceps, but let's call em zombies). It takes a big brain to decide that almost no emphasis should be placed on the very thing that has plunged the character's world into global mass death and chaos. Why would the audience want to see zombies when they specifically choose to tune into a zombie show? That just doesn't make sense ;)

Also, let's take a moment to appreciate the fact that Joel decides that taking a single bolt action rifle (with no scope) with him is better than taking one (or several) semi-automatic rifles with him. Truly a big brain move."

Permalink";"Rather than rehashing how good the tv show is (it is great!) I'm going to try to convince those of you that have not yet played the game on Playstation to give it a try, even if you're not a ""gamer"". When playing, you are no longer just an observer looking at Joel and Ellie's monumental journey, but instead you ARE Joel (and sometimes Ellie). So, when you're playing ""The Last of Us"" you become an active part of the story, making its myriad story plot points much more impactful and more personal. Also, some story elements that were glossed over in the show get much more time to be explored, and there are some key differences between the game's main story and the show that make playing it worthwhile as well.

The best way to describe how much more deeply the game impacted me compared to the show is that, while I was emotionally involved with the characters in the show and it was a very satisfying story, after playing the game I actually wanted to become a father to a daughter of my own. The game's finale destroyed me to my core to an extent that I haven't experienced before, or ever since. So I urge you to give the game a try, even if you're not a gamer. There are enough accessibility options to make it playable for new and seasoned gamers alike."

The twists and turns were unexpected and kept me on the edge of my seat. However, even in the ninth and final episode, the plot continued to surprise me, and I found myself thoroughly invested in the story until the very end.

Unfortunately, the last moment of the series was a major disappointment for me. After building up the story and characters so well throughout the entire season, the final scene felt like a letdown. It was a trashy ending that left a sour taste in my mouth and left me feeling unsatisfied with the overall experience.

Despite the disappointing conclusion, I still believe that the first eight episodes of the series were fantastic. The writers did an excellent job of crafting a gripping and engaging storyline, and the actors brought their characters to life with great skill. It's a shame that the final moments of the series didn't live up to the high standards set by the earlier episodes."

The main problem is that it's very hard to make something different or original when it comes to zombies, because Everything has been done before!! From the ""Walking Dead"" to ""World War Z"" to a dozen others TV Shows or movies, even a movie called ""The Road"" with Viggo Mortensen.

Also, the problem is that you can barely see any zombies; in the entire 9 episodes there's only less than 10 minutes of zombie ""action"", the rest is post-apocalyptic Soap Opera Drama that's been done before.

Every Episode is different, some interesting and some boring, unfortunately, the most interesting one: the Kansas City where they team up with another pair trying to escape could've carry the Show and could've been expanded to 4 episodes!! Is that interesting!! But some reasons unknown it only lasts that One Episode... :( DON'T BOTHER watching this show, instead just go to YouTube and search ""The Last of Us Cinematics"" that last 1 1/2 hours and you would see EXACTLY what you see in the show!! Why bother to do a TV Show if it's going to be exactly what you see in the VideoGame?? God knows."

I was thinking of re-watching the second episode and then watching the third episode . Some people said that the third episode is a throwback episode. I think some people liked it because it was politically correct and some liked it purely because it was an episode of two gay people in a relationship . I don't like throwbacks very much and especially if they're mushy , and sentimental and more so in a horror show. I don't care if the people are gay , straight , bi , or trans etc .

I've seen throwbacks in TWD and it spoiled the Show for me because they were slow , boring and irrelevant . If I wanted to see mush then I'd watch a show that was I knew had mush in it . ( And I don't like mushy shows or films ) I don't want to see blood and guts . I want to see a fun , exciting and intelligent show . I also want it to be fast based . I don't like a slow burner that takes ages to get to a point and by the time it does you've lost interest !

I still haven't decided if I'm going to carry on with this show."

Permalink";"As a game fan, there nothing can be compared to the game, let's be honest here. The drama in the game, the voice acting, music, and the faces are much better. I wouldn't expect a better series, considering that it has been always a challenge to reflect a game into the big screen. Pedro was great, a good choice to play Joel, actually he was the soul of the series, and he did a great job in resembling Joel. Tess and Bill were great too, even though Bill reflected a softer version of the in-game Bill, but it was OK, I love Offerman in all his roles anyway.

Now, the big NO is for Bella portraying Ellie, this was like selecting the worst candidate Among many available ones. The appearance, the acting, the attitude, everything .. weren't enough, Ellie's character deserved a lot more than what Bella has offered. I would have liked to see Sadie Sink for instance, portraying the young energetic -yet- the badass girl, but alas.

The idea of a younger deaf Sam was bad, an older Sam as in the game would have been much better.

Melanie Lynskey -as Kathleen- was a bad choice too, no matter how hard she tries as an actor, she could never portray a violent badass leader character, another bad selection for a side character.

David wasn't a ""bad guy"" enough, there was a gap in building up his character throughout his episode.

The music quality was disappointing, even though it is very similar to the game score, but the issue was with its volume or intensity, it is barely heard in most of the scenes, as if the editor has missed turning its volume up.

Maybe, more episodes would have helped in building up characters and fill the missing gaps, but in general, it was a good watch, and I hope they seek another Ellie if there is a future plan for a second season."

I'll give credit where credit due - This show is absorbing. I would sit down to watch an episode and be fully pulled into the world. Kudos! Normally, in those scenarios I would be all aboard and loving every second of it. But this show was more of a split situation between loving it and frustration.

Probably my biggest complaint is the constant introduction, and subsequent deep dive into the background, of brand new character/s, who really didn't play a big roll in the main plot line. Most of these characters were only in 1 episode, yet the writers spent 30 to 40 minuet's telling their life stories. I felt it derailed the momentum from the main plotline and the central characters. It took me a while to get emotionally attached to Joel and Ellie, but once I did - I wanted to see them on screen and watch their journey play out. I did not want to be lead down a rabbit hole on brand new character/s every other episode.

On the bright side - I liked that the show explored themes of human nature and what people would do to survive in the wake of such a massive disaster. I appreciated the relationship dynamics between the main characters, and found them to be a fun duo on screen. The production quality was good, and care was put into making of this show.

Overall, I am glad I watched this! I hope that future seasons can make some adjustments on the pacing and story layout. But overall, no regrets and watching this one."

Permalink";"Amazing cast, amazing storyline. The Last of Us is a post-apocalyptic video game developed by Naughty Dog, and now it has been adapted as a TV series for HBO, which premiered in 2022. The series, which stars Pedro Pascal as Joel and Bella Ramsey as Ellie, has been highly anticipated by fans of the game, and it does not disappoint. With its stunning visuals, talented cast, and faithful adaptation of the source material, The Last of Us is a must-watch for fans of the game and anyone who loves a good post-apocalyptic story.

One of the most impressive aspects of The Last of Us TV show is how faithfully it captures the look and feel of the original game. The show's production design is top-notch, with sets that look like they were ripped straight from the game. The attention to detail is incredible, from the overgrown city streets to the dilapidated buildings that serve as a backdrop to the characters' journey. The show's visual effects are also impressive, with the infected looking every bit as terrifying as they do in the game.

But what really makes The Last of Us TV show stand out is the strength of its cast. Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey are perfectly cast as Joel and Ellie, respectively, and they bring a depth and nuance to their performances that elevates the material. Pascal's Joel is gruff and world-weary, but he also has a vulnerability that makes you root for him. Ramsey's Ellie, meanwhile, is tough and resourceful, but she also has a vulnerability that makes her relatable. The chemistry between the two actors is electric, and you can't help but get invested in their relationship as they navigate the dangers of the post-apocalyptic world.

The Last of Us TV show also does an excellent job of expanding on the world-building of the game. While the game was primarily focused on Joel and Ellie's journey, the TV show takes the time to explore other characters and their stories. We get to see the inner workings of the Quarantine Zones and the struggles of those who are left behind when the military takes over. We also get a deeper look at the Fireflies, the group of rebels who are trying to find a cure for the infection. These expanded storylines not only flesh out the world of The Last of Us but also give the characters more depth and complexity."

I don't understand all these 10 and 9 ratings. It's a okay show at best. Lots of filler and terrible pacing. Ellie is incredibly annoying and Joel is bland af.

I kind of expected that the infected weren't really going to be a big part of this show because this show goes the not so subtle road of ""ThE HUmAnS ARe ThE REal MoNStErS"". But the amount of time wasted on unnecessary side plots that ultimately add nothing to the overall story was baffling.

I can only explain all these hyper positive reviews with a standard that got lowered so much because of all these mediocre shows we got over the last years.

But seriously this is just ""The walking dead"" with a higher budget and more virtue signaling. To all those that actually want to continue this show: Have fun with season 2 and everyone's favorite golf pro."

The pacing is rushed all these could have been 2 part episode instead of one didn't like new added character Kathleen is super pointless you can remove her not miss a thing but didn't need that for Sam and Henry.

I was kinda bummed the show lacked infected i understand they wanted to focus on relationship with Joel and Ellie but I can see why some people lose interest can be boring some places.

The finale is biggest let down for me it could have been hour instead its 43 minutes. Did like the actress from game who played Ellie is playing her mom though.

Overall, its very overhyped series doesn't deserve it Bella acting as Ellie is very hit and miss sometimes she can give good performance but other times she falls flat she very average at best.

Pedro as Joel is honestly to me is best part of series he got his personality and character down.

. I hope will improve with season 2 not rush it like season 1."

Good things: Obviously the individual performances of Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey, they were soo convincing as Joel and Ellie they couldn't have been portrayed any better. The complex yet beautiful relationship between Joel and Ellie depicted soo well you'll just fall in love with them instantly. The VFX was amazing, the post apocalyptic world they created looked soo realistic.

They almost adapted the game as it is. My favourite episode has to be 8 which i wouldn't be able to describe without giving any spoilers so let's just not get into it.

Bad things: There aren't much cons and i just cannot hate any part of it but still, episode 3 & 7 were kinda, little unnecessary. I'm not saying they were not good, but still they don't provide anything to the main story, like you could just skip the two episodes and it would cause no effect to the main story. However I loved episode 3 cuz it was so beautiful it almost made me cry.

The show is a little inconsistent, i felt that some episodes have like everything in them which made the other ""normal"" episodes look like they were bad.

Overall an excellent game adaptation which couldn't have got any better.

That's all.

Can't wait for season 2&3 !!!"

And it's impossible to not compare the show and the game. I was a bit affraid in the start, since the director seemed to be ""affraid"" to do something new. It followed the game from A to Z both storywise and even images. Luckily, that changed with episode 3,when the show broke the strain. BUT in the end TLOU is based on an immersive game, and lacks just that. You feel you have seen it all before, and better. Bella Ramsey is better than expected as Ellie, but the fragile relationship with Pedro Pascals Joel just don't gel with me. Pascal is simply very onedimensional and boring. I was really hoping for someone with more range. Josh Brolin would have been perfect, but Pascal is the new bread and butter after his Boba Fett show. Other than that, the infected look cheap. Rubber masks and way to clean. The main horror in the show is humans, and it became boring very fast to see Joel and Ellie being hunted each episode. A big plus for the finale, were Joel turns real dark (you can even hear the music turn). BUT I never bought Joel and Ellie together. Unlike the game, Pascals Joel goes from ""not giving a crap"" to fullblown Rambo in one episode to rescue Ellie. This was NOT the best tv show ever, as some fanboys want you to believe. It's good, and very high production values (hell if I know whats CGI and whats not. It looks incredible). But the story isnt that immersive."

Permalink";"I have not played The Last of Us game but I was aware of the controversial decisions made in the sequel. The first season of this show adapts the revered story of the first game. Does it succeed as both an adaptation and as a solid show in its own right? Absolutely.

The Last of Us season 1 is fantastic. Everything about this show is near-flawless. The writing, the characters, the sets, the music and the acting is all great. Pedro Pascal as Joel excellently rides the line between a gruff yet vulnerable loner who has lost everything and a caring, compassionate man hiding the true atrocities he is capable of. His chemistry with Bella Ramsey as Ellie is fantastic, both playing of each other brilliantly. And it's not just the main actors who do a great job, every guest actor is phenomenal, from the wonderful yet tragic couple of Bill and Frank to the unsettling, monstrous David, each actor brings their A-game for their side roles.

Another strong element to praise is the atmosphere. This is a post-apocalyptic show and it nails it. The sets and CGI are excellent, really immersing you in this role. The haunting Chernobyl-esque flashbacks detailing the build-up to the apocalypse makes this scenario feel scarily feasible. To top it all off, The Infected in the show are used sparingly, but when they show up, they are treated as a massive threat. The creature and sound design of these abominations is truly on point but the show never makes them a joke and always makes the point that humanity is ultimately the greater enemy.

Overall, The Last of Us season 1 is a great season of television. Every episode has something to love, the story is tight and yet leaves room for so much discussion (especially at its ending). All elements of production are fantastic, the writing superb and the acting is incredible. While I'm sure the game is likely the definitive experience, this show is definitely worth-watching for those who haven't played the game and from what I understand, is the best example of a faithful video game adaptation."

The acting is solid for the most part but lacking at crucial moments which stop you from really connecting with the characters in my opinion. Also for a zombie survival style series there is a surprising lack of zombies.

This is well worth a watch, especially if you haven't played the original game which is a far superior piece of storytelling. It really does lack anything special to warrant the 10 star reviews though. This is a solid video game adaptation but not a groundbreaking masterpiece. Considering the existing storyline there is to work with, this could have been better."

As live action, we still didn't have productions that good until The Last of Us came out. This, without a doubt, is the best live action based on a game in history. The series manages to improve a lot on what was already amazing in the source material and still maintains the melancholic tone. But, the series is not without defects, as for example, the infected are fundamental to the game's story and are completely overlooked during the entire first season. Some changes cause the series to become too fast and this harms the development of the plot and characters.

Permalink";"As someone who hasn't play the video game but enjoys post apocalyptic stories I was intrigued to see what HBO would deliver with this adaptation. From the first episode I was hook, excitingly waiting for Sunday nights to arrive anxious to know what would happen next. To avoid spoilers I didn't look for similarities between the game and the series but after the season finale. It's impressive how much they were able to bring to the series even after leaving aside some parts of the story, something that basically happens with any adaptation.

Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsay work perfectly together, making the story feel believable without falling into a melodrama. As the viewer is easy to empathize with not only Joel and Ellie but other characters like Bill, portrayed by Nick Offerman, and his heartbreaking but beautiful story. The clickers, the third stage of the infected in, are scary creatures by themselves but thanks to the makeup department led by Barrie Gower (Game of Thrones, Chernobyl, Stranger Things) they turn even more terrifying. The cinematography, soundtrack, storytelling, and acting make of this series more than just a video game adaptation but an impressive survival story with personal battles . The Last of Us joins the group good series created by HBO."

Permalink";"I feel I should probably preface this review by stating that TLOU is one of my favourite games of all time, so certain parts of my review may be slightly biased.

Overall this series is close to perfection in terms of recreating the look and feel of The Last of Us game. The sets, costumes and locations look like they have been ripped right from the game and put on-screen. Dialogue and scenes have been recreated with so much love and attention to detail it is genuinely amazing at times. The original music from the game is also utilised well, although in my opinion not nearly enough.

Pedro Pascal is almost flawless in his interpretation of Joel, he is a phenomenal actor. I took a little while to warm to Bella Ramsey as Ellie, although this may just be as I have held the character so close to heart for so many years. By the end of the series I would say that she had won me over, although she never felt 100% ""Ellie"" to me, more like an alternate version, whereas I totally bought Pedro as Joel by the end of the series.

I do feel that the season could have done with being a few episodes longer, as important parts of the game have been left out in a lot of places. I have seen a lot of people complaining that there wasn't enough action, which I somewhat agree with. The creators have said that they wanted to focus more on the human experience, not just the violence, but I can't help but feel the complete lack of a threat from the infected throughout most of the series will make most people get a little bored! Ellie's character growth throughout the game, as well as her and Joel's trust-building, was shown a lot through combat situations, so this wouldn't have just been ""mindless action"", it would have served a purpose. Having shown Joel actually engage in combat would have made his character feel as dangerous as he should have. This series mainly hints at it right up until the last couple of episodes.

I also think the short run-time of the series hurt the overall feeling of this being an epic, cross country journey that took the best part of a year. I watched it with someone who had never played the game and when asked, she assumed the whole story took place over a couple of months. Also, although I enjoyed the Bill & Frank episode, I think taking an entire hour to focus on two characters who have very little relevance to the actual plot was a very strange choice and just meant they had even more to cram into the remaining episodes.

Lastly, no-one got killed by a brick. One of my favourite things to do in the game! A crying shame!"

From the very first episode I was hooked. The show has kept me wondering what will happen next.

There was a little filler that I did not think necessary but I enjoyed it anyway.

When the fungi people would come around and the way the disease evolved made the show even more exciting.

They explained the story lines of the two major characters. That was great. Some shows take forever to do that.

Once again I am very thankful there is a fresh storyline out there."

The cinematography is very good, resulting in so many shots being beautiful to look at. The colour palettes were imaginative and the show makes good use of mood lighting too. Also, the set designs are all incredibly and really help immerse the audience into this world! The designs of the zombies are great too, the Bloater looked horrifying.

The score is pretty and sets the mood well, and the sound design is extremely effective. Also, I adore the soundtrack and find it to be very appropriate, fitting and well used.

The show gives us perfect introductions to each character, and they're all flawlessly casted! Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsay were phenomenal in their roles, and they perfectly captured what makes Joel and Ellie so loveable and their friendship. I also loved Frank and Bill, the representation of a queer relationship is so well written and their episode brought me to tears!

Lastly, the show is quite slow paced and takes a good amount of time to build up the plot and characters, which I feel is a good decision. It's consistently engaging and packed full of brutally emotional moments that leave an impact on the viewer."

Permalink";"Most likely I will be lynched for what I'm about to say but yes, arrived at the last episode, I can say that I do not give a damn about Ellie and Joel.

We assume that I didn't play video games (I'm not a gamer) so basically I don't have the emotional attachment that they can have after playing and loving part 1 and part 2. I want to specify this because for someone starting from scratch, It's not obvious to love these characters, love is earned. By that I mean that TLOU is a bad series? Absolutely not, at the level of production and interpretation of the actors is definitely above average. Did the affection I feel for Pedro and Bella make me love their characters too? I wouldn't say, because I think I'm one of the few who does not wait for the second season in the least and I want to say it because it seems that this series is either very loved and considered a masterpiece on one side, or detested on the other. I can say that I am in a middle way, I did not appreciate it because it did not transmit anything to follow the story of these two characters and absurdly I was much more excited with Sam and Henry, to name a few. While other characters like Tommy and Marlene seemed rather useless, especially her that I expected to be deepened a bit more but apparently not, of these Fireflies we do not know much.

In conclusion, it is always strange when a long-awaited TV series comes out and creates this kind of mass hysteria, success does not always mean appreciation, and I hope that fans of the video game and the TV series can accept different opinions from their own."

Permalink";"'The Last of Us' has a plot-line we've seen before. The world is at its 'end', infected zombies roam the planet, a few surviving human outposts remain. A young teen (played by Bella Ramsey) is thought to be immune from the infection and so she is being escorted (by Joel, played by Pedro Pascal) across the country to a hospital where, it is hoped, she can be studied and operated on. Whatever it is that makes her immune can then be turned into a vaccine.

Much credit to the series stars Pascal and particularly, Ramsey. They are spectacular in the way that actors should be; We care about them; we care a great deal. We understand them and, as we do, we forgive them their faults. And particularly in the case of Joel (Pascal's character) there are many.

However, 'The Last of Us' is, through its first season, very uneven. Some episodes are great (#3, #5, #9), others (#4, #7) are talk-filled and, as such, boring to the hilt. I, for one, was particularly taken by the season's Episode #3. It might not be everyone's 'cup of tea' but I was touched by the story, enjoyed the relatively quick pacing, and how the story of the episode's two main characters intersected with the series' main characters.

But more uneven still is the fact that in that in the most boring of the episodes - and always in their final five minutes - something dramatic does take place. Something, an event, a death, a cliff-hanger, that has impact on the plot, on the coming episodes. And so you do not want to fast-forward through the slow moments as you might actually miss something.

And then the lighting - or lack of it; far too much of this series takes place in the dark. And yes, I know, the Last-of-Us-World is ending, and electricity is scarce and precious. But still. There is daylight. And little or nothing happens during those well-lit hours of the day.

Finally, I know nothing about the video game on which this series is based. I suspect that there will be future episodes / seasons to come (though based on the discussion following the Season #1 finale, I can't be certain). There's really nothing more I can add. See it. But know it has its shortcomings."

Permalink";"A relatively good story about a glimpse of light in an otherwise dark, mold-infested world. The show mainly suffers from pacing problems, the weakest of episodes being Episode 7. Surprisingly, a lot of the scenes in this show are practically shot-for-shot, line-for-line recreations of the video game, if somewhat condensed. The main deviations (aside from the lack of spores) come from episodes 3 and 7, when they deviate from Joel and Ellie's journey to focus on past events. While these moments are good on their own (at least episode 3, which gets me to cry big, incredibly manly tears every time), they do cause a major disruption in the overall story for relatively little payoff.

There are plenty of nods to the game alongside the closeness to its source material however, with plenty of references to game mechanics and including the game's original cast. It was always a small joy to find these things myself, though they were obviously lost on my mother, who watched this with me despite never having heard of the game. Still, she rather liked it (and rated it higher than I), so there's definitely plenty here for those not acquainted with the Cordyceps and clickers."

Permalink";"We've all grown accustomed to how usually game adaptations into movies or TV shows end up becoming, they are so messed up and difficult to translate to a different media that almost all content that was adapted from them that've seen to this point (the only exception being Arcane) ends up being disappointing, this is where The Last of Us shines..

I've played both games at this stage and my only regret is that I wasn't able to enjoy the story for the first time while watching the show because I feel it would've caused me an even bigger impact but I cannot be unfair in my rating just because I knew the events beforehand.

The show does a lot of things right, the locations and cinematography is amazing, the casting is outstanding - yes I was also hesitant about the esthetic differences between Bella Ramsey and Ellie's character but she does such an amazing job that my doubts were erased - the pacing (for most of the episodes) is spot on as it doesn't drag at all (it actually becomes slightly too fast by the end) .

The most direct comparison I can make (from a TV show standpoint) is with the Walking Dead, another apocalyptic show that went on to became a mess of boring repetitive storylines and right on the first episode the Last of Us does critical things that TWD didn't do in 11 years, it explores the origins of the pandemic, it shows how it was before it happened and there's an actual potential cure in sight!

Contrary to some of the critics I've seen I actually enjoyed the content that drifted from the original games as it explores a lot more the characters that cross Joel and Ellie's path and as per the example above (of the origins of the pandemic) it adds value to the whole story.

I agree that the ending episodes felt a bit rushed and perhaps one or two more episodes would've been ideal to tell the last part of the story, also some more infected being present would've also been good however with all things considered, the fact that this is one of the most beloved games of all time the expectations were so high that the fact that it managed to match most of them is quite the achievement, it could've done some things differently but as a whole I thoroughly enjoyed it and for me it was a successful adaptation, looking forward to season 2."

Permalink";"The Last of Us is fun viewing, but doesn't have the plot twists and shockers that made The Walking Dead, its predecessor, so engaging. Nor does it have the character development. My husband and I predicted every death. The mushroom monsters appeared conveniently in Deus Ex Machina style every time an enemy needed to be vanquished.

Lots of the most shocking plot moments from the Walking Dead appear in the Last of Us, but watered down and less terrifying.

It has the feel of being on a theme park ride - you move through a landscape and see enemies confined to one episode. Each episode feels like a mini movie, though none would be satisfying as a standalone.

The series begun with a huge amount of exposition: a man on a panel explains why fungus is more worrying than viruses and bacteria, and explains the mechanisms behind the cordyceps fungus that controls ants - that comes straight from David Attenborough's commentary. Though it worked to a point, it was a missed opportunity to dripfeed suspense and dread. We could have spent a few episodes wondering what the hell this thing is when told it's not a virus or a bacteria.

A lot of the dialogue is expositional throughout, and took us away from feeling immersed. E.g. When Ellie gets in a car for the first time, she is surprised - great - did she need to say ""it feels like being in a spaceship""? This sounds like something someone in a writer's room would say ""imagine, you've never been in a car before, it must feel like being in a spaceship"" but doesn't feel organic coming from the character themselves.

There's no fellowship, though there are opportunities for one with Tess and Henry. Allies and enemies come and go. There's no strong sense of why Joel is hellbent on going ahead with his mission.

The story is over reliant on flashbacks to tell the story.

Our favourite episode was the standalone one with Bill and Frank.

Pedro Pascal is a great lead. So too is Bella Ramsey.

Overall we enjoyed the scenery but the story was predictable and Hollywood. As such, it might feel shinier and faster paced to some viewers, but it lacks the finesse, stakes and writing that made The Walking Dead so good."

Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey are incredible in their desperate roles as Joel and Ellie, roaming the countryside, battling increasingly hideous danger along the way. Their relationship is the center that holds the rest together.

The opening episode takes us right into the encroaching nightmare, giving us a novel, terrifying reason behind the coming apocalypse. THE LAST OF US manages to put a fresh spin on an old subject, creating a new experience for the viewer.

It's laudable that the show's makers have opted to allow the characters to be human, reacting in genuine ways, instead of being ""super heroes"". Weaknesses are revealed and some mistakes are made, but Joel and Ellie stay intact. Also, people are killed. Lots of people that one might expect to live. Decisions are made, and some of those decisions can be shocking!

Personally, having finished season one, I can't wait for season two..."

Permalink";"As good as anything on TV at the moment. Reminds me of the first couple of seasons of The Walking Dead, easy to fall into this genre without too much exposition because audiences are so familiar with TWD. Simpler because it's only two central characters rather than a group. The lead characters have their share of inexplicable good luck and incompetence of challengers... but hey, that's showbiz. Inspired casting to team up two GOT actors, and who isn't happy to watch Pedro (Joel). He has a great range and is once again believable in the lead role. I can't help wonder what a great role Ellie would have been for Maisie Williams (Arya), but maybe age was a factor in casting. Anyway, this is easy to watch, pacing is maybe just a little slow - but not problematic. There is nothing that makes me want to switch off. The trouble they will have is making/releasing subsequent seasons quickly enough to retain attention. Let's see what the writers can bring to keep this interesting. This was the issue with Ozark, Better Call Saul, Mentalist (particularly in Australia where release of new seasons were delayed due to rights issues), and many other shows. What worked for some shows is making more episodes per season, meaning less gap between each annual release. The biggest issues I had were all in the final episode 9. Joel's remarkable recovery from his deathbed... Ellie noisily dropping the ladder and Joel failing to lift the ladder back up behind them to protect their rear were all inexplicable. Having the Doctor and Fireflies leap to sacrificing Ellie as the ONLY possible option was ridiculous (ie. Let's not bother to try synthesising a treatment from Ellie's blood first - let's just chop out her brain as Option A). Having Joel then morph into John Wick was bizarre... but maybe that mass body count speaks to the US audience?? I counted 16 kills (including the hilariously written doctor) which seemed to be an unnecessarily high body count. Finally, i don't understand why they can't readily find a functional vehicle and siphon fuel to keep it running to get to their destination, apparently they can at the very end of episode 9? Anyway, minor quibbles - but I hope the writers will not continue to rely upon such dubious plot devices to rescue our lead characters."

The creators have done a great job at expanding on the storyline in the game by diving into the backstories and inner-lives of the characters, making them feel more human and connected in the post apocalyptic world. There's a lot less action than in the game and my only complaint would be that there could be more infected in the show, but the storytelling makes up for it. Pedro and Bella deliver the bond between Joel and Ellie beautifully and it was captivating to see it grow. Most anticipation and excitement I've felt for a show in a while and it lives up to the expectations."

In other words this show is better than TWD, though to be fair that show started of great and ran down hill a little every year until it hit season 8 or 9, where it fell off the cliff completely (and lost about 90% of the audience). I know this show is based on a video game, but the acting is very good and so far it seems like a more complete show even though the story has been basic. HBO is the best network for series for many (if not most) people and they have done a good job with this one. Hopefully they will know when the time is right to hang it up and not crush its own legacy, like TWD did."

However, the two episodes that are not part of the canon are both back stories for inconsequential characters. They do nothing for the plot. So why are they there?

For what it's worth both of these episodes are ok, to a point, but ultimately, pointless.

The last episode just ran for the finish line, obviously in a hurry to wind up the series and move on the the story for the much maligned second game plot.

I do hope they learn from their lessons. I'm not holding my breath though."

There's nothing wrong with a slow pace and building characters IF the characters are actually interesting, multilayered, relatable or credible in any way. The show makes its two main characters, an insufferable combo of boring and irritating, walk through insignificant miniplots or gets stuck in uninteresting, predictable backstories offering nothing but elementary emotional manipulation and clichés. Not to mention each flashback is three times as long as you'd want it to be.

Even having never played the game, I feel like the video game source material was a burden on this show and contributed to the plot-armoured unidimensional main duo, the monotonic linear structure of the main plot and almost none of the events having any real consequence. One of the most disappointing shows I've seen in quite a while, sorry to say."

Taken as a stand alone TV series, it's watchable and reasonably enjoyable, but no way on earth is it worthy of the 9/10 it currently has on IMDB. I can only assume the people giving it maximum scores are those that play the video game, so have some form of attachment to the title and story.

The performances by the 2 lead characters are what carries this, as the story is one that's been done many times before and in all honesty, been done better.

Some of the ""effects / prosthetics"" of the infected are embarrassing, with some infected seeming to be wearing cycling helmets with some papier-mâché on them.

Whilst there are a few action sequences, it's really quite a slow burn that at times, feels a bit of a chore.

The ultimate measure, is that I'm not desperate to see a second series.

In summary: Slow burn, drags at times, laughable costumes, well known storyline but saved from being awful by 2 excellent leads."

My wife was not at fond at the beginning, but totally hooked at the end. We both want it to continue.

The acting is top notch, the story, while dystopian, points towards promise and it has the feel of a video game - episodic situations that the protagonists find themselves in, and have to get out of (often with violence). The portrayal of the fungus based pandemic is disturbing, as it should be. And yet for all of that, it is really a drama about two people trying survive under great stress, in the most difficult conditions. The personal element is what makes it so resonant.

Perfect? No, but what is? But highly recommended. Well worth the 9 hours."

I held off on judgement until I finished the first season, but now I can personally say that this show is only popular because of the legacy of the game and because of Pedro Pascal's popularity. The story is completely rudderless, most of the episodes don't drive the story or progress the main characters at all. The heavily praised third episode with gay Ron Swanson isn't applicable to the rest of the story at all and it's the longest episode! Well-made or not, it contributes nothing to the overarching story of the show and has zero repercussions for our protagonists. The character development, chemistry, and dialogue is extremely clunky; the story is all over the place, with no apparent direction; and overall, most of the episodes are boring. It feels like a live-action remake of all of the cut-scenes in the game, but without the engaging gameplay that makes the cutscenes in the game make sense.

If the game hadn't preceded this show and we weren't so depraved for good cinema and TV, this show never would have received the attention it has. It's entertaining enough to watch, but giving it anymore than an average review is being too generous."

The storyline.... HIGHLY PREDICTABLE. I've seen this show before (at least 3 times in the last decade).

I cannot understand how this show is so highly rated. Is it because there's a gaming community all hyped up about a screen adaptation ?

Please, It's on the same level (or almost) - of great shows, fully developed, and masterfully written.

I am giving it a 5 because the costumes, makeup, set design/déco is excellent. Otherwise, it would've been a 2 - The HBO intro is just amazing.

A little bit of objectivity please."

Permalink";"I have a mixed opinion on this series. Post apocalyptic shows have become an obsession of mine, so when I heard this show was coming out I was incredibly excited! First of all, Pedro Pascal (Joel) and Bella Ramsey (Ellie) were both over the top, amazing actors!! They fit the role perfectly! My first complaint is, you can definitely tell this was based on a linear video game rather than 'real life' fiction if that makes sense. Each episode is like a small challenge that you have to overcome in order to get to the finish line. I feel like the writers and producers could have done a much better job of taking the game and making it into their own unique story rather than sticking to the exact trajectory of the game from start to finish. Also, the way the show introduced new characters each episode and killed them off by the end of the episode is another aspect I didn't care for...this makes perfect sense in a video game, but when this happens in movies and TV shows it almost feels like it was pointless to even meet those characters in the first place. Last but not least, where are the monsters?!?!? I understand that ONE costume had a hefty price tag, but it seems like we barely saw any monsters after the scene where that was used. (Now I will admit, that scene was AWESOME!!!!) But I wish there would've been more scenes like this! Overall I definitely enjoyed this show and would highly recommend it. I just hope season two brings us a little more thrills and monsters. I also hope it ventures more on the line of real life apocalyptic rather than a linear start to finish storyline."

At one point a woman says he is capable but he is not, not even close. He makes too many technical mistakes. Example is that instead of arming himself with the proper weapons, he does just the opposite. At the home of the Survival guy was an armory but instead of taking serious weapons and supplies, he does just the opposite. He reason for having a gun is combat but he takes a six shot revolver and a Hunting rifle instead of a Hi-Capacity simi and a hunting bolt action rifle instead of a Assault rifle of which their were many. From skirmish to skirmish he leaves guns and ammo while sticking to all the wrong weapons. He leaves food and supplies everywhere taking nothing along. He is no Scrounger which is the only way you could survive for all those years. He acts like he is taking a walk in the park. She saves his life and he takes her gun, why. He then tells her to keep it in her bag, a good place for it. Very disapointing and not a NINE by any means."

I'm just a little annoyed by the critics (gamers) who have to compare the series with the game over and over again. That's totally absurd. What does one have to do with the other? Just because the series is based on the game doesn't mean it has to tell the exact same story. I've never played the game and never will, so I consider the series just as a fan of good TV series.

The actual story was condensed to work in unnecessary side filler plots.

The many flashback scenes scattered throughout the series lasted way too long and barely moved the plot forward. We didn't learn anything in 30 minutes that couldn't have been summed up in 5. It was boring.

The pacing of the series was completely off. The entire thing either felt like a drag or rushed.

The filler episode (Episode 3) was okay but i didn't particularly enjoy it and it's completely irrelevant with the rest of the plot so feel free to skip.

I did however really enjoy the dynamic between Joel and Ellie throughout."

The reason I say that is because the game is about 10 hours long with like able characters, great character development, and enough action to please the player. The show removed almost all of the action that was in the game at the beginning, They removed all of the interesting dialogue that made the characters interesting, and they added long and boring parts to the show that weren't in the game. Another thing about the game is that it was very focused around the characters just like the show is, but in the game the characters have interesting dialogue and along with some other things to keep you entertained. In the game they genuinely try to make the characters like able so you get attached. They don't do that in the show."

I've seen a lot of people complaining that it was different from the game, but I really liked that they went much deeper and did a great job in developing the characters and bringing other characters as well. I actually felt that they could go even further and generate their own story and I hope they do that in the second season."

Permalink";"First I must say that this is, in my opinion at least, the best video game adaption ever made. It's respectful to the source material and to us gamers that have played the game. Which is not a common thing. I loved the game. One of the best games I have ever played, at least when it comes to storytelling and interesting characters with great story and character development! The series captures maybe 90 % of this, which is why I think the game is still a bit better.

In my opinion, the series should have been a bit longer. Sometimes they really deep dived into some parts and characters, and sometimes it was the opposite and felt a bit rushed. An example of this is episode 3 with the story of Bill and Frank, which we did not get much of in the game. I loved this episode. They did a slightly different version of their story and relationship which was fantastic and very, very emotional to watch. I liked this version more than the version in the game. I think that the version in the game was a bit weird to be honest, where Bill was just bitter and saying bad things about Frank, and we did not even get to see Frank and make our own opinion about him. This episode was about 75 minutes long, and almost everything in this episode was not even in the game.

Then we have some episodes that are only about 40-50 minutes long, and almost everything in these episodes are identical to those parts of the game, but cut down a bit. They should have extended these episodes, because otherwise this makes the relationship, chemistry and character development between Joel and Ellie to not reach its full potential. Also, it would have been nice to see just a tiny bit more of the infected, which there would have been more room for if the series was a bit longer. This is the only reason why I can't give it 10/10, which means my final rating is 9/10.

Otherwise I thought that the series was fantastic with great acting and cast! It's a masterpiece if you compare it to other video game adaptions, like Resident Evil, which was a complete disaster and disappointment.

I can't wait for season 2 and the continuation of Joel and Ellie's journey!"

It seems HBO likes to grab on to stuff that they then have to fluff and stretch out to make a series - GOT was the same thing only in that case they outpaced the source material. This show is certainly better than that Walking Dead stuff but it is sorely overrated. Anything above an 8/10 in my book is absurd... There is absolutely no way this show is on the same level as Breaking Bad, The Sopranos, Band of Brothers, etc."

First of all, the two main characters are given a proper arc. Their stories of their journey, individually as well as together, are thrilling to say the least. So the writers of game/show have done a great job there. But the best part is casting of Pedro and Bella. These are one of the finest acting performances I have seen in past few years. Pedro is already recognised as a good actor from other shows. But Bella is a revelation! I am really looking forward to her upcoming projects now.

In the second half of the show, I was starting to wonder how they are going to conclude the story neatly when no relief seemed possible. But the ending also needs to be applauded for being different and yet, completely understandable from the way the story progresses through each episode.

Special mention of episode 3! Just brilliant!"

Permalink";"Hopefully, other studios will see this series as proof that you CAN make a faithful adaptation of a video game that people will watch and enjoy. Resident Evil tried and failed, Halo tried and failed, Hitman tried and failed, Doom tried and failed, Max Payne tried and failed, but all of the studios behind those awful adaptations simply needed to RESPECT the source material. Throughout this series, I recognized and reveled in the shockingly accurate recreations of settings taken directly from the game, frequently exclaiming (to nobody but myself), ""I REMEMBER THIS LEVEL!!!""

The Last Of Us proves that video games can be adapted into film and television without deviation and people will love it. You don't need to add subplots, you don't need to change significant plot points and characters, you just need to care about your source material, the same as any series or film based on a book. Video games can and often do have good stories, and even without the interactivity of a video game, those stories that people fell in love with can be fantastic in any medium. I pray that other studios will watch this series and realize that screwing with the stories their fans love isn't the way to succeed. THIS is the way to succeed: with love, faith, and reverence. The people have noticed, and now the studios will notice."

Permalink";"Honestly, I think this is a great show for people who haven't played the game. However, for those of us who are cursed to have done so, it is an incredible let-down. Scenes that are not part of the game's storyline and don't do much to further the plot are drawn-out and turned into whole episodes, while scenes that are some of the most important and impactful in the game are dismissed, have different chapters merged into one scene, and lack the sense of high stakes that was ever present in the source material.

The first 2 episodes are spectacular and extremely loyal to the game, but everything after that is what I would consider a series of bad decisions, with the 2 last episodes of the 1st season being perhaps the biggest disappointment in television since the final season of Game of Thrones. The presence of the infected, which is one of the core aspects of the lore, is lackluster to say the least, with many scenes that have major fights against tons of them in the game being turned into 30-second scenes with few or no infected in the show. Same thing goes for other enemies. For a show with a big budget, it sure felt like they were on a crunch for money and wanted to save on SFX and on side characters/ensembles. The 2 last episodes should've been spread out into at least 4 episodes for the story not to feel as rushed as it did and for this show to have any chance of redemption.

My advice: if you haven't played the game yet, go do that and forget about this show of mediocrity. But if you feel like you really need to watch this, do it before playing the game. It will feel much less underwhelming.

7/10 is the score I give it trying my best to pretend that I haven't played the game. With the game in mind, this is a 5/10 tops.

HBO, do better."

Permalink";"Of course I had to watch ""The Last of Us"", since it was based on the game. And also I was somewhat thrilled that they had Pedro Pascal to portray the role of Joel. And I did enjoy playing the first of the games, though I never have tried part II.

And of course with ""The Last of Us"" being a thing that has infected - or zombies - in it, then I had to watch it given my fascination with all things zombie.

The storyline in ""The Last of Us"" is adequate, and it is somewhat true to the story in the game. However, you shouldn't expect a series based solely and entirely on the contents from the games though. That would make for a dull experience.

I enjoyed the story in ""The Last of Us"", because it is a diverse one that brings the audience to many different locations and for different purposes. So the series, thankfully, doesn't get too monotonous throughout its first season.

The acting performances in ""The Last of Us"" are good, and they have a good cast ensemble for portraying the various roles. Pedro Pascal does a good job as Joel. And while I am unfamiliar Bella Ramsey, playing Ellie, I think she does a good job. Sure, the Ellie character is somewhat different than what is portrayed in the game, but it is a minor issue really.

Something that works well in favor of ""The Last of Us"" is the environment that the story takes place in. Lots of nice locations that definitely look run down, in disrepair and having been reclaimed mostly by Mother Earth. It looked and felt like a post apocalyptic setting, and I enjoyed that.

Visually then ""The Last of Us"" was quite good. Nice effects and the infected look great.

However, ""The Last of Us"" isn't all praise and woohoo's though. For a series based on a computer game with infected/zombies, then you get to see surprisingly few of them throughout the episodes. Sure, there was one episode with a heap of infected, but throughout most of the episodes of season one you don't even get to see a single infected. Somewhat disappointing actually, because it somewhat holds the series back from further greatness.

""The Last of Us"" is definitely enjoyable, entertaining and watchable. However, it was just lacking in the threat of the infected that apparently brought about the end of civilization.

My rating of ""The Last of Us"", of season one at least, lands on a six out of ten stars."

Permalink";"I have no idea why this show has such the high rating it does. It's boring. Beyond boring. Much more boring than The Walking Dead became.

This show is based around a fungus type virus (based on the very real Cordyceps fungus which is one of the most horrifyingly beautiful organisms on the planet. This thing is the source of nightmares. So, it would seem to fit right in in a post-apocalyptic show.

Problem is, it's barely in the show.

I'd bet, in the entire first season, there is maybe, *MAYBE* 30 minutes of screen time combined in all the episodes, the rest is just boring exposition dialog. The show stays very close to the game from which it is adapted but all the tension in the game is forgone for hours of wasteful dialog.

After watching the entire season, two episodes were a complete waste of time. Those are the episode with Bill and Frank and the episode which just should have been called ""How Ellie Got Bit"" both were boring and did not really move the story along in any meaningful way. Sure, there was some backstory to Bill, which we meet in the game, but it still felt forced and unnecessary in the over scheme of the first season.

Being an HBO show it's shiny and they hired decent actors to play the roles, however, that can't save the show from the fact that's it's so boring, you could watch the first 10 minutes of an episode, get the gist of what's happening then skip right to the last 15 minutes and I'd bet you wouldn't miss much.

The thing about the game is that there are moments of intense tension with small sections where you can catch your breath. That tension isn't captured in this adaptation, mainly due to the lack of the real danger, the infected."

Permalink";"What began as an exciting post-apocalyptic zombie thriller, quickly devolved into a boring video game adaptation that actually started to feel like you were watching someone play a video game.

But before I start complaining, here's what I liked:

The set, costumes, and cinematography were excellent. They truly built an amazing world and the scariest zombies on TV. I was absolutely repulsed by their depiction of the fungus. They knocked this out of the park.

Pedro Pascal is always great.

And the rest? I mostly hated. Here are my biggest complaints:

The story of season 1 was choppy and lacked a compelling through line. Every episode felt so self-contained (almost like a level of a video game...), that it was hard to feel compelled to watch the next one.

There was no real villain. I have never seen a show like this just refuse to employ a true villain character. The showrunners instead seemed content that each episode had a ""boss"" to beat. While that may work for video games, it doesn't work for TV. There is no ""game to beat"" while watching TV, but this show did leave me feeling like finishing it would be the ultimate challenge.

It's barely a zombie show. TLOU does zombies so well. And then forgets that they exist 75% of the time. Some viewers might appreciate this. I did not.

It's impatient. Every time you met a villain or a conflict, you could reasonably count on a resolution by the episode's end. The showrunners seemingly had no patience for letting viewers sit in suspense. If there was a problem, it had to be solved within 60 minutes. Thus, they developed a bit of a ""boy who cried wolf"" reputation with my wife & I.

Even the characters didn't care that much about staying alive. In high school, I loved The Walking Dead. I loved the feeling that the characters would do anything to survive. That made me care about their journeys. In TLOU, the characters barely even care about staying alive (Ellie refuses to stop yelling), so why should I care if they live or die?

Ultimately, for me TLOU was a massive disappointment. The visceral fear I felt in episodes 1 & 2 never returned and finishing this show was a chore.

The context, actors, and cinematography provided a really fun opportunity to create something extraordinary. It seems to me that they wholly missed the mark. Season 2 will be a hard pass for me."

It's true, one of the best games on PlayStation by far, but this is a review for his TV series adaptation.

Genuinely, series plays out very similar to the game with many noticeable scenes with no spoilers, our main leads Ellie 'Bella Ramsay' & Joel 'Pedro Pascal' are just brilliant with a strong supporting cast to match.

World building and set pieces are brilliant and fungus like zombies are brilliant and their sounds only add to the fear when not scene.

Only real downside is, series did feel a little rushed to get to the end of 'Part 1' where some episodes nothing really happens so pacing did feel a little off.

But overall, great acting, earthy & compelling, let's hope series 2 picks up the pace with a few more zombies to add!"

I just wished they had dragged the initial apocalypse out over a couple of episodes. I don't know anything about the games so I have nothing to compare like others here. For me, the best episodes were the ones with actual zombies in them. And, they were few and far between.

The one episode with the mass of zombies coming out of the ground was fantastic. Unfortunately, much of the show episodes are, talking and introspection and good guys vs. Bad (living) guys.

Give me a show like Black Summer, anytime. There's definitely less talking, and more action on that series. Also, the episodes are only around 35 mins or so. Not enough time for script meandering.

You're never really certain if the main characters are going to survive, and you're never really certain if their possible deaths will be at the hands of the elements, the infected, or the remaining human. The central characters have an unlikely yet very compelling relationship that begins strained yet blossoms into something very beautiful. Each episode is a total surprise - you don't know what you're going to get. It could be love or it could be horror. Bella Ramsey and Pedro Pascal certainly deserve Emmys for their acting, as each one brings a strength and a vulnerability to the show. Excellent, excellent work."

Casting is excellent and I thoroughly liked this. Bella Ramsey had me yelling at the screen in the beginning - ""that's not how little witches talk!"" Lol. I am so glad she was part of this.

Watching this on HBO Max and I didn't realize until almost the end of the season that previews for the next episode were tucked in after the credits, which was disappointing, but that's ok really.

Can't wait for season 2!"

I can only assume the high scores are from gamers who play the game and didn't actually watch the series, How this is scoring a 9 is a joke. 7-8 for the first two episodes, the rest were all a one at best.

The only saving grace is Pedro Pascal as Joel, he is about the only redeeming feature of this whole thing. I hope he doesn't end up type cast, because the role he plays is essentially the same role as the Mandelorian. The lone gun slinger taking on the bad guys. The series could have gone from episode 1,2 to 9 and skipped the rest and no one would have missed a thing."

Permalink";"The latest HBO phenomenon is undoubtedly the adaptation of the popular video game The Last of Us. The series had the great backpack of being able to be the exception to a trend that does not accompany much of the adaptations of games to the big screen or television.

Being in the right hands already invited us to feel some peace of mind when waiting for something quite good. Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann carry out a really studied and forceful job to perfectly adapt a game that already had a lot of cinematography, but whose creators are capable of transporting that beauty to the screen with total poise.

Another great success for the adaptation to work is the good casting they do. Having Pedro Pascal, perhaps the most popular actor at the moment and although resisted, but intelligently chosen, Bella Ramsey allows us to enjoy a spectacular on-screen chemistry between them and also the abilities of the two when it comes to interpreting their characters and giving them a own stamp, but without forgetting the deep blood of two characters who are perfect in the video game.

The Chilean actor knows how to differentiate himself from his already iconic The Mandalorian, to give his own life to a Joel Miller that catches you as we watch the entire season of the series. For her part, Bella Ramsey gives her best to give us a forceful Ellie Williams without objections, giving personality and charisma to a character that takes the series one step further.

A series that maintains its forcefulness from episode 1 to the end of the season, with wonderful episodes and other more leisurely ones that complement a series that dares to have internationally varied directors and who are delivering that talent in the service of telling us a story that will It captivates as it goes by with total forcefulness.

An adaptation with personality that has a clear seal of complexing us as viewers, making us debate decisions and also giving us what we like so much about one of the best video games the industry has delivered.

On this occasion we can say that the mixture of games and television has its reward thanks to an adaptation that was never limited to losing personality and giving us all the good things of a game with all the codes of television fiction.

One of the best series so far this year and a promising second season that prepares us as a challenge to maintain all the good and excellent that was achieved in its first season and try to raise the status a bit to turn The Last of Us into an essential part of our lives.

HBO knows how to make series and that security will always be at their hand to give us that necessary forcefulness for a viewer who is demanding when we talk about successful adaptations, they more than achieve that first challenge by giving an almost perfect series that manages to captivate fans and not fans of a Sunday to Sunday game.

The Last of Us is a series that needs to be watched, loved, and enjoyed with absolute pleasure."

It's very average. Openly boring, unoriginal, cliche and tired. The show barely featured the cool monsters and instead explored all the usual ""people are the real bad guys"" themes found in most post-apocalyptic media these days.

Everything you'd expect from a TV show with high production values were there and the acting was good but not outstanding.

Copying and pasting whole cutscenes from the game is lazy.

Permalink";"The Last of Us videogame had a good story and great acting. It was already very cinematic so I was skeptical about the need to turn it into a TV show.

Unfortunately, they missed the mark. For a start, 9 episodes was not enough. Not only did they cut corners, but they also added content which wasn't in the game.

The premise of The Last of Us is Ellie being immune to the infection which has nearly destroyed all of humanity, but the show fails to show us how the infected have made adventuring outside quarantine zones so dangerous. They appear in only 3 episodes of out 9. Part of Joel an Ellie's journey is also surviving against the hordes of infected and not just humans. There is a middle ground between all out action and nothing at all.

The casting and characters are good, but I don't think Bella Ramsay was the best choice for Ellie. Nick Offerman as Bill was fantastic. It's a shame we never got to see him interact with Joel and Ellie. Too little time was spent with Henry and Sam while Kathleen, a completely new and useless character, was given a backstory and plenty of scenes over 2 episodes. David was shown as a villain right away while originally in the game, he seemed like a good guy and gained Ellie's trust. There was no need to make him a christian preacher either.

The most important part of The Last of Us is the relationship between the 2 main characters. Joel and Ellie are supposed to bond over time and all the key scenes are directly lifted from the game, but it's so rushed on the show that none of it seems earned. The relationship needed to breathe a little and feature more small moments where the 2 of them interact like a father and daughter."

Permalink";"The Last of Us 2023 series is a must-watch for fans of the original video game and newcomers alike. The show delivers an incredible story that is both captivating and emotional, with incredible performances from its talented cast of actors.

Based on the beloved video game of the same name, The Last of Us series follows the journey of Joel (played by Pedro Pascal), a smuggler tasked with escorting a young girl named Ellie (played by Bella Ramsey) across a post-apocalyptic United States. The series does an excellent job of capturing the gritty and intense tone of the video game while also expanding on the story and characters in a way that is both satisfying and surprising.

One of the most notable aspects of the show is its incredible attention to detail. From the stunning cinematography to the haunting score, every aspect of the production is top-notch. The showrunners clearly had a deep love and respect for the source material, and it shows in every frame.

One of the most impressive aspects of the show is the performances of its cast. Pedro Pascal delivers an incredible performance as Joel, capturing the character's gruff exterior and vulnerable interior with ease. Bella Ramsey is equally impressive as Ellie, portraying the character's toughness and vulnerability in a way that is both compelling and relatable.

But what really sets The Last of Us series apart from the video game is its ability to expand on the world and characters in a way that feels both organic and necessary. The show takes its time to explore the relationships between the characters and the harsh realities of the world they live in, resulting in a story that is both emotionally resonant and action-packed.

Overall, The Last of Us 2023 series is a triumph of storytelling and a must-watch for anyone looking for a thrilling and emotional journey. With its incredible performances, stunning production design, and attention to detail, this series is sure to capture the hearts of audiences everywhere. So sit back, grab some popcorn, and get ready for an unforgettable journey through the post-apocalyptic world of The Last of Us."

Permalink";"I have no background with the source material. I watched and judged this show simply on its own merit. It starts with an amazing first episode that got me so excited. It seemed like a much more high quality version of the walking dead, especially with the awesome one-take scenes that reminded me of True Detective. I already thought Pedro Pascal was a star, and he continues to prove it.

After episode one, we meander in these super boring episodes where nothing happens. There are two entire episodes that do zero, ZERO, to move the plot forward. At the end of the episode, we are in the exact same place story-wise as the start of the episode. I understand the importance of building characters. But we've seen numerous examples of shows that are able to have character-building, plot movement, action scenes, and so much more, all within a single episode.

We meet new characters but as soon as we get attached, they're no longer in the show for one reason or another. All of the ""shocking"" moments are things I've seen many times before. There isn't anything special about this show aside from Pedro Pascal. I forced myself to finish this season and will not be watching season 2.

HBO was already on my ####-list after cancelling one of the best shows on TV in Westworld. It may not have been as amazing in the later seasons, but they only wanted one more season to conclude the story. After learning about the merger with Discovery, and what these companies do to slash costs, regardless of what the fans want, I'm borderline done with HBO. The only thing remaining that I have interest in is Raised by Wolves. They'll probably cancel that too. They're even removing past season of HBO original content. Smh. They were once at the top of the mountain but continue to tumble to the bottom through mismanagement and greed. (1 viewing, 3/14/2023)"

The story is not brutally cut down and everything important is there. The atmosphere is also great and the chemistry between Joel and Ellie works at 1*. The excellent performances of Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey are also related to this. Someone criticizes the lack of action and the almost absence of clickers......and there really aren't many of them. But it doesn't bother me, because it is all the more based on dialogues and characters. As a result, The Last of Us is a worthy adaptation of an even better game. 9/10 for me."

For my part they could have made this first game into 2 or 3 seasons. All they had to do was stick to the source material. Many of the places and interactions in the game outside of the cut scenes built into the story and the relationships. And then they could have expanded other areas like bill's romance. And still had the parts with Bill and ellie together. We missed all the terrifying things about the infected that made the choice at the end so poignant. I was a big enough fan of the game to have bought it on 3 different systems. This series just left me feeling empty and betrayed."

Considering The Last Of Us game my favourite and the best game I've played in my life, it's still better than the serie but this last one is more complete and interesting at the same time. The new small stories and characters make the whole script richer and more satisfying.

Every performance from all the casts are wonderful but I have to say that Bella Ramsey's performance is better than Pedro Pascal's. I still feel like Pedro doesn't make me imagine and see Joel from the game. On the other hand, Bella was brilliant for me and her representation makes me feel like I was watching Ellie.

I wish I'd watched more action scenes and drama like the game but I can understand the sake of being less violent and more immersive in the main story.

One of the most nostalgic but beautiful moments was when we heard the soundtrack which was exactly the same as the game. When I started to hear it my hair was automatically stood on end and I felt like if I was in the game.

I'm really excited about what could come next and the new stories that they can build in the second season to bring us the greatest entertainment and best thriller based on a video game."

Specifically, the actress that plays Ellie shows little to no emotion in her performance and her lines almost seem as it's forced out of her mouth. Just pay attention to any sequence in the show where the characters are supposed to be sad or scared; you'll see literally no emotions in her face. This may obviously be because of lack of experience, but there are many child actors that do well (Stranger Things). Hopefully, in future seasons she'll improve.

On a side note, episode 3 is the best standalone episode of any tv series."

It's certainly not up there with the best TV series I've ever seen, so far, but it has been an awesomely exciting ride through the end of season one. The writing and direction are strong, but it is the two leads, Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey, that ultimately make this work as well as it does. They are fantastic! There was not a weak episode in our latest apocalyptic obsession, but episode three was an unexpected heartbreaker and episode 8 was terrifying, but they all kind of were in some way or another. This is an outstanding production in every aspect with a ton of strong supporting performers, some known, most unknown. I could be wrong, but other than the character of Tommy, Pascal's brother on the show, I don't think there is a person of significance still alive as we end the first season. Quite unusual and not carrying around endless extra unneeded storylines is refreshing. I look forward to season two. I hope it's not a year away."

Permalink";"This show is simultaneously a great show, while also being incredibly disappointing. As a lover of the games, I am impressed with it as an adaptation as generally game adaptations are terrible. It is a high quality show with so many deep, emotional elements and strong attention to detail. The sets are amazing. The acting is good. The dialogue is well written. However, I can't say that it met my expectations for the source material. Again, it's not because it is bad, but because it had an incredibly high bar to clear.

I do not expect it to be exactly like the game. I understand changes needed to be made, and some of those changes were great. But overall, there were things that felt lacking or missing from this show.

The first two episodes do a wonderful job of establishing the world and its many dangers. We meet the characters, get introduced to the world, and learn its rules. They explain the infectious disease to us, how it started, how it works, and why it's dangerous. They do such a good job with this. Then, it's as if they completely abandon that world.

In episode three, we get a beautiful love story. This was one of the best episodes of television I've ever seen. Did it have much relevance to the plot? Not so much other than thematically, but I didn't have a problem with that because it was so good and worth watching.

After episode three though, I felt like the show went downhill. It's not that it was bad, it's just that it seemed more focused strictly on establishing the emotional bond between the two main characters and having a few run ins with other people. Both those elements are integral to the story obviously, but they should still be happening within the confines of the world that was established.

Episode 5 gives us another brief reminder of the infected, but then it gets abandoned again for the rest of the duration of the show other than through a couple of flashbacks.

I found this extremely weird. I am not an action lover by any means. I despise long fight or chase scenes. I am not looking for blood, gore, explosions, or violence. However, it is so extremely weird to almost entirely ignore this element of the world after having established it (and it being major part of the premise). Again, I don't want Joel and Elie to spend all their time fighting zombies. However, I want to see them encounter some, even if they are just avoiding them. The show seemed to be really adverse to showing them, I assume because it was expensive or something, but with the largest budget in HBO history, it's just odd to omit them. I understand man is the real monster and all that, and I'm certainly not advocating to remove the human threat, but both should have been present.

What this show really lacked was suspense. Every tense moment was relieved within seconds. Yes, dialogue can have tension, but they did a really poor job of creating or sustaining any sort of suspense.

Overall, if you want an emotional story of the love between a father figure and daughter figure, it is lovely. But it isn't much more than that. I wanted more. I wanted the richness of the world. I wanted more development of those story beats that they skimmed past or entirely omitted. This should have been stretched into two seasons, or this season should have been longer. I hope they don't cheap out on further season(s)."

This show has anything I wanted from the game and more. It takes the core story beats of the game, while adding a bunch of great executed changes compared to the video game. Especially in episode 3 with Bill and Frank. It changed alot, but it still comes down to the same thing.

The casting and acting is sublime as well. Bella Ramsey is a great actor for Ellie and does a fantastic job of portraying Ellie. In episode 8, Bella really proved everyone wrong that doubted about her.

The only con is it is a bit too short. If it had 2 or 3 episodes more, than it would have been near perfection. I get that the game is not that long too, but adding more onto the story would have made it into a masterpiece.

The Last of Us made me laugh, cry and making me feel horrified. I have a very good feeling that this show is going to be the best show of 2023!

Verdict: 9/10."

The show's post-apocalyptic world is brought to life with stunning visuals and excellent performances from the cast. The story follows the journey of Joel and Ellie, two survivors in a world overrun by infected humans. Their bond grows stronger with every passing episode as they face impossible odds and make tough decisions to survive.

The writing is superb and the pacing is just right, never slowing down too much or feeling rushed.

Permalink";"This right here is a damn good show, an adaptation of a game that came out in 2013 and it hits 95% of it and adds it's own flavour that high-tens the experience of the show.

We have Joel and Ellie, Joel a man who is haunted by his past losing his daughter to the apocalypse and doing some presumably disturbing things to stay alive with his brother Tommy that we don't venture in this season ( hopefully we get to see it ), 20 years after the outbreak is tasked with getting Ellie a 14 year old girl who is immune across country to the fireflies so she can be the cure.

The premise is fairly standard but it's the relationships they make with others and especially each other that make the show so drawing. Joel being a stand off character and Ellie being constantly chatty, but under all her hard exterior is just a girl who is scared and seeks comfort.

After playing the game many times I am extremely happy with how this show has turned out, it hit almost all the important scenes which really draws the gamer to the screen. The cinematography and the score are absolutely brilliant, the story is beautiful and overall I love it.

It's not all perfect, I feel we needed more infected and action in the show, I know it's not a game but after the first 3 episodes I think we only saw infected maybe twice ? This made the world feel a little too safe, we started off as a horror/drama/survival and that horror element slowly faded away which bumped me a bit because they nailed it, we did get a really strong action scene but bar 1 or 2 that was it and I do think we needed some more of that.

Look, the show absolutely nailed the relationships and made changes to the game that only shined even more, looking at the ratings ep3 was heavily review bombed due to LGBT in my opinion, some may genuinely not have liked it and that's fine but when average 60-90k ratings on all the episodes jumps to 200k+ for an episode heavily LGBT it is just annoying, in contrast ep7 was also lower and in my opinion rightly so as I myself thought it a little slow after ep6 BUT it was a good ep just not in the right spot for me, there was a reason I think it was a DLC not in main game.

Overall though I had a blast, staying up till 2am every Sunday to see this, maybe S2 comes out at 7 or 8 so I'm not up as late hahahaha I think the entire cast were so perfect especially Joel and Ellie, knowing what happens in the second game and hearing it will take 2 or more seasons to cover makes me excited and I have so much faith in all involved as they have DELIVERED with S1, only criticism is more infected, more action ( not buckets, well when we get KILLER ELLIE I want loads hahaha) and bring back that horror feeling, even every few episodes make me scared for our characters!

One of the best shows in a long time."

I can do slow if it's gripping, like True Detective or Breaking Bad at times (amazing shows). But for some reason this just didn't do it for me. That's not to say it's a bad show - it's well made and shot, but I didn't get super excited each week when the episodes came out.

It's realistic because some of our politicians during the covid pandemic acted like they wanted such a scenario. But the action is very good and measured, the dialog is fine, when you consider the characters are just average people. Some people didn't get the isolated episodes, but it's clear the show is setting up for a long run so it can afford to be methodical in how it is presented. If you really want non-stop action, there are plenty of short, self-contained movies gear for you."

Permalink";"I know that I'm supposed to think that this is the best thing on tv in 2023. I don't. The performances of Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey are exceptional however. They raise this whole production considerably and they kept me watching until the end of season one when I would otherwise have lost interest a third of the way in. On the negative side even allowing for the fantastical storyline some of the plot twists are just a bit too much of a stretch with Joel at times as indestructible as Schwarzenegger's Terminator and there's occasional elements of the kind of gross violence that sent the Walking Dead down the rabbit hole from which it never recovered. In fairness there is much less of that here and it's balanced with a dialogue and storyline in between such events and with some tender sections along the way. In this regard Episode 3 is superbly done and is almost a standalone film within the series. There's also some accomplished cinematography. Overall Pascal and Ramsey are utterly believable in their roles and we don't doubt their evolving relationship as they proceed on their journey. That was enough to keep me engaged with this first season but I'm not convinced that I'll rush back in to watch if and when a second season emerges."

Don't get me started on how much of a shockingly good performance Bella put on. Just great. Some parts could've been more descriptive but overall, it lives up to its name. If I could recommend this show to anyone, I'd do it in a heartbeat. The amount of times I cried watching this especially the way tlou actors deliver each emotion onto our screens is insane. I never expected to grow an emotional attachment to the way an actor portrays a character. Just amazing."

Everything about the Video Game is Masterpiece.

But the show....wasn't a masterpiece.

It was average. It tried to copy the game too much, in the end it felt rushed.

I didn't feel connected to Joel or Ellie.

The jokes Ellie made in the show, felt rushed and didn't really hit me like the game does.

The wasn't enough chemistry between Joel & Ellie.

Don't misunderstand, the actors were great but it felt like it was missing something....maybe a soul. It was just bland and average.

I would recommend to people to play the game instead."

Permalink";"I have certainly binged on my share of apocalyptic series during this new golden age of streaming television. We have been flooded with shows in the last decade, ranging from viruses to natural disasters to aliens. However, the premise of Last of Us is compelling and terrifying, the humble fungus gaining a foothold due to the climate change we are witnessing before our eyes.

The world depicted is appropriately bleak and desolate, with the lurking infected just out of peripheral vision. The set pieces are excellent, eerie and evocative - rivalling the depressing vistas of The Road.

As usual, we see that human evil continues to thrive in the last strongholds of humankind, a classic disappointment. We cannot resist turning to tyranny at the first possible chance, with the silent majority of the remnant minority allowing evil to rise.

This is also the age of Pedro Pascal, the everyman thespian who slides effortlessly into every single role he plays. What a tour de force - he depicts a broken warrior with smoothness and credibility. A man seeking redemption in the face of a lifetime of sin.

Bella Ramsey is brilliant, insightful, stinging and delightful. I expect huge things from this fantastic actor - she will continue to bowl us over for decades. She shows tremendous bravery and courage in every scene, a fitting role.

There is no doubt every single episode of this masterpiece is well crafted and thought out, and delivers maximum emotional impact. There are no fake emotions here, each well-cast actor plays their role with genuineness and frankness.

The extremely difficult choices of the final episode leave a ringing sound in my mind. We are truly defined by what happened in the past, and sometimes some are unhealed by time, and others are healed by other things."

I look forward to seeing another season. I'm guessing we can look to the game to see what season 2 might have in store. The gay couple was important and well received. More of that please!

Here's to quality storytelling. Please keep it strange and sexy!"

Permalink";"To start I gave this movie a 5, which to me means its good enough to watch but your life won't change if you don't. 6-9 scales up from you should give it a try to your world will get rocked. 10 should be reserved for movies or shows that make such an impression on you that lasts a lifetime. For many and rightly so a movie like The Godfather is a 10.

This series' only clout is how well its adapted from a popular video game. Take that element away and let it stand on its own merit you will have to admit its only a decent sci-fi drama.

I have to say I was biased towards episode 3 based on the buzz over the scenes. But it is HBO after all and anything goes. That kind of content is to be expected. I came to really like that episode despite what some people may feel. It was well done and very touching, excuse the pun.

I really liked the Joel character played by PP who took his job seriously. Everyone else is just reading lines or giggling through the script. Even the zombies are not terribly convincing.

Once more, a score of 10 should mean the show cannot do any better than it is. A 10 should mean you can watch it many more times and still get a thrill like your first viewing. Sadly I think most people overrated this and watered down the value of the 10 stars. 10 should be precious people don't give it away like chewing gum."

Permalink";"Look, I know the game is known for its characters and storytelling over just non stop action but there just seemed to be a total lack of infected to the point I forgot they were even involved. I was hoping to see more large scale attacks even against the Fireflies; most action scenes are reduced to minor skirmishes other than the 1st and last episode..

I just wanted to feel more dread like I did in the game when I heard the sounds of multiple clickers with next to nothing on ammo. Not really to be found in this show. I did enjoy the scene with the clickers just felt there could have been more to leave a lasting impression.

As far as acting goes I actually really liked Ellie not over the game version but I felt like she stood on her own and had spunk. I did start to feel her and Joel bonding as the show progressed.

Speaking of Joel I felt he was played fine the problem for me was that at times I felt the delivery was there pretty much anytime he was pissed and going to retrieve Ellie and others I didn't it felt flat or I wanted a little more emotion or expression in other areas. To much whispering.

I felt all the other actors did fine for their respective roles with Tommy being a stand out for me.

I personally didn't like Episode 3 it was to much time wasted on a not so much important character only to drag it out into a romance, no thanks will never want to watch that even if it wasn't a same sex couple any kind of cheesy romance would bog this material down and that's what was on display here I won't even go into nitpicking how silly some of it was, I'm sure someone else has beat me to it.

Visually it did have some impressive shots some that did look straight out of the game but nothing to memorable nothing you shouldn't expect from a big budget HBO production. The bloater scene was cool though.

Overall this one's tough to rate I really enjoyed most of the episodes other then the one mentioned earlier I just couldn't shake this feeling of it missing something for me so I was somewhat let down. I also don't think the show is gonna be good for rewatching it's just not as rewarding as the game."

Where are the zombies barely any zombies in a zombie apocalypse i think is a massive mistake we have seen characters in issues with interactions but I didn't see a world breaking event I saw Ellie and Joel's adventure easy as brushing teeth in the game there journey is hard cos the zombies keep putting walls up to stop the protagonists and the antagonists. In this it's something happens and that's all barely any zombies stopped this from being a ten. Left behind was perfect but I think as a bonus episode at the end would of been better as it stopped the journey that last of us fans have been dreaming of since the game was released. Hopefully next season they realise that zombies in this world is needed."

The world presented here is fascinating and feels authentic as a post apocalyptic society.

I feel this series had so many interesting paths it COULD have taken.

The first few episodes set the perfect scene. Some felt episode 3 'Long, long time' derailed the series but I personally loved it. It was 'real life' inside this new world. It was a beautiful love letter to human relationships.

However, as the series went on, I felt the episodes were rushed.

The dialogue was cheesy at times. The characters and the relationships weren't developed enough.

The action fell away and the focus became telling too many half hearted stories.

The penultimate episode was well paced and the performances were excellent but in the end I'm left unsatisfied by the finale.

I have hopes for season 2 and won't give up watching yet!"

Permalink";"It's not because I want more action, or more horror - I just think a lot of these scenes and texts could have used more room to breath and sink in. It feels like an abridged version which was editted down from a much more complete whole. I'd love to see the director's cut.

Having said that - this show is great. That it has all of the story beats, and what feels like 60% of the original script in there, is a testament to the story but also the willingness to adapt it properly. What it changes is used to flesh out not just characters but also the world itself, making it feel more lived-in. The anthological structure conferred to the show by the ""levels"" of the game works incredibly well in telling smaller stories that are moving and brilliant.

The actors are great, too.

Anyway - I wish they gave us more breathing room. Otherwise - this is great TV, and a nigh on perfect adaptation."

You must watch this series without comparison, then you will enjoy it. Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsay have a very good relationship and I can't see anyone else as Joel and Ellie. From this story, it can be understood that nothing goes according to wishes and it is not always what we want, and if we do not appreciate the things we have, we will understand how valuable they are by losing them and we will do anything to have them again. Whatever score this series gets, it is important to convey the sense of the story well to the viewer. Thanks to the actors and producers of this series."

It's well made but the pacing is terrible with some episodes having nothing of real note happen. Some episodes longer than others and having a 42 minute finale made no sense to me, could have stretched that out longer surely. At no point did it feel particularly gripping outwith perhaps the first episode. Somewhat controversially I thought episode 3 was arguably the best episode outwith the first one. Feel generous rating a 7, will watch next season but not particularly looking forward to it."

Permalink";"""Love can conquer, heal, transcend everything"" - this is a commonly thrown, rather vague trope used to glorify the power of love. But the reality couldn't be further away from such Platonic idea (of course according to my experience and reflections). The story and the storytelling of season 01 of The Last of Us leaves a deep emotional resonance in me before it captured the bleakness and brutality of human nature so damn good.

Using the theme of love, they subvert the trope. Love here costs so much that the consequence of your actions (driven by the sentiment of love) weights on you till your death, the consequences of your action ends a good man's life, the consequences of your action denies the humanity a chance. Sentiment of love and the sense of being protective is nothing abnormal neither new, it's been ingrained in us since our origin even when we weren't even homo sapiens. But that most certainly turns into a deep flaw when you are a deeply traumatized person in a tragic world. Our reality is as screwed as the reality of The Last of Us. So many of us are hurt, traumatized, all worse of all, we are repressing all the past and newly added pains. Especially when you are a person who struggles with the stability of mental health - i.e: someone with an immense fear of abandonment (Joel, Ellie) - a new found hold of love is capable of clouding your judgement so gray, it's often impossible to see through your scars and your clouds. Love conquers? No. Love corrupts.

The ending felt really tragic and bleak to me. Ellies knows deep inside what damage has been done. I am pretty sure she feels heartbroken and adding even more burden of existence in her baggage of trauma.

Like the portrayal of character with complex psychological state, the storytelling is equally nuanced. In each episode, I noticed little details in visual storytelling that proved that the writers and the directors trusted the intelligence of their audience. The showing or expositions are subtle and precise. Restrained use of zombies, or zombie hordes helps keeping the tension fresh and dreadful each time. Joel's rage and OP moments were also helped by the lack of them: interrogation of Davin's men, and the finale scene of Joel going inhuman in the hospital - these two felt so visceral because the build up to those moments were so earned.

The Last of Us - is a peak cinema to me."

Permalink";"Let me start with saying this is one of the best video game adaptations. There's a lot to love in this series that thankfully stayed true to the game while creating space for the show to be it's own so that it wasn't just an exact copy paste. The production, acting, and everything included delivered like a big budget series. It was entertaining for majority of the series but it did have some issues.

The main issue I noticed was the inconsistency of the episodes. Each episode felt like it truly had a different feel to it. Unfortunately that didn't always work out for me. Isolating the series by each episode is what ultimately caused me to not rate it overall higher because there were some episodes that just felt flat.

In terms of casting and characters I felt that the decisions to switch it all up was actually part of what made this show separate from the game and allow it to be good on its own. Although, as much as I really wanted to like Bella Ramsey as Ellie I just for whatever the reason could not. She's really the only character from the show that for some reason didn't feel like the best fit. However, she did do a good job and my person preference/discrepancy aside was a different but good Ellie.

There's a couple episodes that I felt didn't really contribute towards the overall development of the show. They might have been entertaining or were meant to add to the complexities of the show but unfortunately most of the time whatever they were supposed to do ultimately was erased by the end of that episode. My main example would be bill & frank. It was a great storyline but if you removed it from the show and think of it all as a whole did it really make a difference if it was included or not to the main storyline? No not really. However, it would have been an amazing spin-off or could have been a better episode by having more investment into their stories with Joel. Instead he basically just showed up at the end and was like oh - well at least he left me his car with that battery I've been looking for and then cue episode ending.

Finally, the most important criticism of them all. The infected. Where were they? They were decently included for the first half of the series and then they basically disappeared in the second half of the series. It's starting to take some of the corner cutting of shows like the walking dead where the focus shifts away from the post-apocalyptic infected survivors facing them + bad people to just people wondering around until they inevitably find bad people and eventually overcome them. I'm not a fan of it. I think it's cheap and loses sight of the catalysts driving the narrative behind everything. I mean the game was mainly stealth because of how many infected there always was but in the show they just walk around openly no sweat about the infected but they were definitely worried about other people. To me that's an indicator that they lost a bit of focus for the show.

People will complain because they would rather watch a post-apocalyptic neighborhood/high school style tv show than what the content really is which is supposed to be a post-apocalyptic survivorship filled with drama already in it. Yes I'm aware not every second has to be a thrilling action packed show, but that doesn't mean you erase the main fabric of the show either. They will be upset because personally I feel there may have been better options for who played Ellie even though she did do a good job and I just didn't care for her specifically. People will be upset because I'm critical of episodes that are shielded by what they represented or the statement they were trying to convey through storytelling but as a critic of the show I noticed they weren't pivotal to the main storylines progression or could have been accomplished without an entire episode to do it.

People have a right to their own opinions and this is mine. I felt that this was one of the best video game adaptations that fortunately stayed very accurate to the games story while allowing it to develop its own identity. Unfortunately it also lost it's focus and struggled to establish a consistency in each episode & properly convey the main storyline without being sidetracked or ultimately rushed. I mean start to finish by the end it didn't have the same effect that the game did. There's a lot factoring into that but honestly it felt like the show played it a bit safe, conservative with infected, and underwhelmed the main plot by losing focus on it through out. I felt like I kept waiting for that moment where I went ""YES!"" and the whole series just took a leap into the right direction (like red wedding in GOT or similar) but it just never happened for me. 6/10 - Good not great but has potential to be so much better. I'm excited for the next season and I hope some of the criticisms and feedback will help to improve it."

I beleive that the last of us was worthy to watch and i am so eager to watch season 2 of the series,,,

the Last of us series is orriginnaly based on the Play station game made by sony computers Ent.

It is the first time that a series have been made based on a video game...

the games story was so strong and original that it had the potential to make not a movie but a 3 seasons series from it,, what an amzing game was it!!

I had played and ended the video game when it was released on my playstation 4 console and was in my all time top 5 games.. and i've played all the best games so i know what an amazing video game that was indeed :))

the story is about a man that has a doughter named sara about 16 years old and they are living in the US.. a virus starts to epidemic and starts to spread all over the world and in a short time it gets from the asia to america and in the beging they want to bomb all the cities that the zombie virus has been affected the people to stop it from spreading but thet didnt sucseed..

the virus comes to the city that joel and sara are living and begins to spread all over the city.. joel losts her doughter in the very first episode ...

the series has been a copy of the original vido games story but it make it wider and views more angles to it and opens up the story in the best way possible

execuse my english because im not a native speaker but i tried my best...

Permalink";"I would rate Season 1 a 7.5 out of 10 overall.

It's a pretty good adaptation of the game, but a lot of the emotional moments and tension fall short compared to the game.

The background and supporting characters are well-developed, but the main character's emotions are not fleshed out enough.

As I mentioned earlier, the show spends too much time on the background and supporting characters, and there's simply not enough time to develop the main character, who is supposed to be the focus of the show.

Unless you have a lot of episodes to work with, it's hard to understand how even new characters can be given a full episode.

The fight scenes are well-done, but they miss out on many of the life-or-death moments from the game.

Don't think that these moments aren't important, because cutting them out takes away from the story's emphasis on relationships.

Originally, these moments were meant to deepen the characters' relationships, and the feeling of overcoming obstacles was lost when the show became more of a road trip.

I can't accept the excuse that these moments were cut for the sake of realism, because in a zombie apocalypse, it's not realistic to travel miles without encountering any zombies.

Making the third episode end with a happy-ever-after is also unrealistic.

The most obvious reason for these cuts is budget constraints and the limited number of episodes in the season.

As a result, the show had to cut so much that it focused its budget on only a few scenes, like the teeth-chattering and bloater scenes.

The new hive mind setting was also only given one episode, which is disappointing.

It feels like the show jumps around too much to focus on the important events, cutting out too much in between."

Yes, at the beginning I had some complaints about the casting, but over time you get used to these actors, and it's an adaptation, not a casting. The series tells some moments in different ways, sometimes in favor, sometimes not, but it's not bad, on the contrary, it makes it more interesting. All the episodes (except the third one) are just great, I watched them in one breath. And as for the third episode...., well, it happens, the main thing is that it didn't hurt the other episodes of the series. In my opinion, this is the best adaptation of not only the game, but also the best adaptation of all adaptations of books, games, and other things. I recommend it to fans of the game of the same name, and those who have never heard of the game will like it even more."

My Rating 9/10 No spoilers

Well now that we've seen the final instalment of apocalyptic thriller The Last of Us the good news is that a second season is definitely on order and should go into production later this year . It only took 2 episodes for HBO to order another series .

With this weeks final episode of The Last Of Us we are left with a terrible conundrum. What will we do without our weekly fix of Joel played by Pedro Pascal) and Ellie played by Bella Ramsey

The Last of Us is an apocalyptic thriller by the creators of the superb Chernobyl series have struck oil unlike the recent similar series The Rig .

The series was based on a board game and has spectacle ,thrills ,amazing special effects and most importantly for me an intelligent script with emotion and relevance.

I was totally hooked especially after the third episode which told the tragic but beautiful love story of Bill and Frank, played by Nick Offerman and Murray Bartlett moved me to tears .

The episodic chapters are what I enjoy the most about this quality series which I would almost bet money on that it will achieve at the Emmys what the movie Everything Everywhere All at Once achieved yesterday at the Oscars .

The pairing of Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey was inspired watching their characters and loyalty to each other grow as they walk a life threatening tightrope each day trying to virtually save what is left of civilisation after a deadly demonic mutated virus has turned most of the population into crazed zombie cannibalistic killers .

One bite from these so called survivors and the infected human soon turns into the same sick monster hiding away ready to pounce on anyone spared from this virus they call The Cordyceps brain infection or CBI.

Sound gruesome ? Parts of this series are very gruesome but each episode contains such a compelling human interest story that even the faint hearted will be drawn to the characters and their plight to survive .

The outstanding performance for me is from 19 year old Bella Ramsey as Ellie the tough Tom boyish heroine of the series who has an immunity to the virus and give hope to a possible vaccine.

Her performance has knocked my socks off I also thought she was wonderful in the medieval series Birdie.

I can't help comparing Pedro Pascal to the late Burt Reynolds he also gives a sensational performance as Joel both characters have suffered great personal loss . Both Ellie and Joel the prime characters find connection and friendship with each other in this virtually desolated world where chaos and danger rules every waking day.

The Production and special effects are superb and the team of Directors plus screen writer Craig Mazin who has adapted the PlayStation video game by Neil Druckmann have created a binge worthy series of the calibre of Game of Thrones in my opinion.

What can we expect in series 2 ?

I read this is where things get tricky, as a lot depends on how much of the plot of the first game is covered in the first season of the show."

Permalink";"This has to be the best game adaption ever made, it is so close to the sorce material you can recognise someone the conversations and different enough to keep you interested.

The more indepth story we ate given for Bill and Frank is by far my favourite episode.

The character of Kathleen humanised the raiders you meet in the Pittsburgh, instead of just seeing them as a mindless, murderous rabble like in the game.

Great pacing, great action and touching quiet moments.

The only thing I didn't see that I would like to have, was an extended back story for Joel and Tommy, showing us some of the things they did to survive in the first years of the pandemic, we hear it was bad but see none of it, this however doesn't take away from the quality of the show.

I hope season 2 keeps the high standard set in season 1."

Permalink";"After watching Chernobyl and this, it's obvious Craig Mazin knows how to tell a story on screen exceptionally well. But, and there's a couple big buts, I never felt any sense of connection to Joel or Ellie and I never felt immersed in the story.

Joel feels like two characters smashed into one, the strong, assertive, competent but flawed game Joel, and the weak, damaged, acceptably not masculine for today's society Joel. Similarly, Ellie changes between being an inexperienced teenager who hasn't seen death and the horrors of the post-apocalyptic world she lives in and being a strong, capable girlboss who needs to take charge and put Joel in his place. Both Joel and Ellie's personalities would fit perfectly in today's society but make no logical sense given the post-apocalyptic society the show is set in.

Add on that there was nowhere near enough time given to Joel and Ellie's relationship. I'll be the first person to say that the episode about Bill and Frank was an exceptional piece of storytelling, but both it and the Riley episode just feel like wasted time and only serve to undercut the pacing of the story. All together, instead of feeling like a surrogate father and daughter growing together over the course of a long, difficult journey, it feels like siblings on a road trip with some occasional difficulties.

Also, where are all the infected? This is, conceptually, a zombie show, but it's very easy to forget that fact when they are shown or even mentioned as rarely as they are. Gone are the infected that are a terrifying force that have driven humanity into small, fortified settlements and forcing people to make the worst choices imaginable. Now the infected are largely an inconvenience, only used to progress the plot while the focus lies almost exclusively on people.

As a whole, it just comes off as disappointing. There are so many good scenes in this show, the cinematography is excellent, most of the sets look amazing, the acting is mostly very good, and a lot of the homages to the game are fantastic. But the pacing is terrible, the characters are unbelievable and grating, and far too much is ignored to fit an entire story, plus two side-stories, into nine episodes."

I also didn't like Bella Ramsey at all. I'm glad I gave it a chance.

The last of us is a show about human relationships and there are so many beautiful and touching moments. I cared so much about the characters. Even those we only met for one episode.

Bella Ramsey is a great actress. Her portrayal of Ellie and her relationship with Joel is beautiful. You Watch it unfold and develop until its satisfying conclusion.

I'm very much looking forward to season 2.

Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey were sensational. Perfectly cast with great chemistry. You really felt their relationship developing, all leading to Joel's decision in the finale. The final episode was so faithful to the game, and even though I knew what was going to happen I was still on the edge of my seat. The tension!!!

A lot of it watched like levels of a computer game, which it was, which makes it harder to watch as it takes you out of the story. A lot of contrived stories to get the guns out and barely any character development. Clunky dialogue and no overriding arc to pull all the disparate stories together. Not worth the hype.

The acting is good, the locations are okay, but there is a ""go to"" look and they will use any excuse to pull the guns out. To make a TV show that follows a computer game without changing much of the format, makes it hard viewing."

Pedro Pascal is hired to smuggle Ellie played by Bella Ramsey who might hold the secret to cure all of humanity. Each episode depicts a certain region where they travel together and they depend on each other for survival. There are cameos who played significant roles along the way like Anna Torv, Melanie Lynskey, Lamar Johnson, Jeffrey Pierce, Scott Shepherd, Nick Offerman and Murray Bartlett play a loving gay couple, John Hannah, Terry Chen, villainous Christopher Heyerdahl and Graham Greene.

Permalink";"This is a review from a non-gamer point of view, but needless to say, I did watch a few gameplays and side-by-side comparisons of the show in reference to the game.

What really made this show enthralling was the pilot episode, it was a great way to start off a show, promising characters to root for, action and more importantly the realism.

One of the few things that The Last Of Us does better than its competitions is that it really gives us a satisfying explanation to the origin of the apocalypse, the way it deals with the scientific aspects of the fungus and its effects, makes it more believable and scary.

Everything from the lead actors' performances and stunning visuals to the beautiful story and large action sequences is just really great. The bleak post apocalyptic world deals with not only dying, blood thirsty creatures, but also equally worse humans. The environment of the show sets the story to be dark and intense at times, leaving us heartbroken and rooting for characters to live and do what they were destined to. I really enjoyed watching this show.

But i really felt that more screentime could have been given to Joel and Ellie's story and bond, and that they could have added a little more action, not with humans, but with clickers. I felt clickers should have been given more screentime to make the episodes more interesting. But overall, a great watch.

**Solid 9.5 on 10 from me**"

Permalink";"Undoubtedly, they tried to make something out of a (as usual) thin video game story, but Last Of Us shows that pretty elaborate pictures and imagined background stories of characters and good acting are not enough to make an exciting series out of it. Apart from a bit of action here and there, nothing happens in many episodes. I was bored again and again. Furthermore, Last Of Us, like many zombie series, makes the mistake of losing sight of the mystery of the plague itself. The audience has to deal with the (past) lives of the main protagonists all the time, and that's it. The Walking Dead excited me (the first seasons) much more than the first season of Last Of Us.

If the series wasn't so good visually and if the actors weren't so convincing, this series would hardly be worth 4 stars, and the currently 9 stars seem to have come mainly from enthusiastic video game fans. ;)"

This is genuinely one of the greatest shows ever made, and I'm not just saying that because it was filmed in Alberta! The show is a work of art. It's such an intelligent, emotional story with fascinating characters, strong world-building, and excellent storytelling all the way through. And before you judge, NO ITS NOT A ZOMBIE SHOW. It's so much more than that, and deals with themes of love, family, humanity and how we move through trauma. It's a beautiful show, and if I had to point to the most clear example of that I'd point to episode 3. For those who've seen it, need I say more? That episode which focused on Bill and Frank and their relationship growing through the world going to hell was a thing of beauty. Yes, it emotionally scarred me, but that was only because of how strong the storytelling and acting was; it elicited such a strong emotional response out of me and I look back on that episode as one of the greatest episodes of TV I have ever seen! And that's not to say that the rest of the show is bad in comparison, the entire series is beautiful and always handled emotion, character and relationships so well. As someone who loved the game, I loved the show, and everyone who I know who's seen it but hasn't played the game has also fallen in love with it! Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann crafted a truly special show here, and Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey were perfect as Joel and Ellie. Do yourself a favour and check this show out as soon as you can, it's the gold standard for what can be done on tv, with excellent writing, directing, production design, cinematography, and acting. No hyperbole, it's one of the best shows I've ever seen and an excellent exploration of humanity and love. It's a beautiful story and exceeded all my (very high) expectations!"

Permalink";"""The Last of Us"" on PlayStation 3 was one of the most entertaining and fulfilling gaming experiences that I've ever had, so when I heard the show was being made, I got excited. Then it was announced that Pedro Pascal was taking over the role of Joel. That's when my excitement elevated to the next level. After seeing every episode, I am very comfortable in declaring that this is the best video game adaptation ever created. One of the most beautiful things about the show is how accurate it is to the gaming experience. From the development of the characters, to the locations, to the plot points in the story; even in interactions between characters such as Joel and Ellie. Not only that, the creative liberties the show took were fun to watch as well. This show is the definition of perfect. The performances are very good (specially from Pascal and Bella Ramsey), the effects; both special and visual, are very strong, the story and writing are very well developed over the nine episodes, and the combination of the music, the cinematography, and the sets/costumes, do a very good job at immersing you in this dark apocalyptic world. There no wonder as to why the show was so successful; the proof is in the Cordyceps fungus pudding."

We watched as the story was altered, the overplay of the frank and bill episode(especially the deaths) who were minor game characters that some forgot, and the lack of clickers, bloaters etc as the journey was far less eventful than the game ever was. It just felt it was trying to hard to win the approval of modern audience when ignoring features of the game.

What it made up for was keeping to most of the story, the great scenery of what happend to society, bt it lacked the spores, the monsters, the horror and tension. It was too soft. As if scared to frighten the audience. It was just another failure of a game adaption to me."

The best adaptation of a videogame that could have been made for television.

Probably the only show I'll ever watch in my life where I've given every episode a 10/10 rating.

I must admit that at the time the cast for this series was announced I had my doubts. Until before this series I had not seen the work of any of the actors, but now it is more than clear to me. Pedro Pascal IS Joel and Bella Ramsey definitely IS Ellie.

The directors couldn't have chosen someone else who would have done a better job than these two.

Beyond the cast and the performances of this series, another thing that I really liked were the settings which gave an exact appearance of a post apocalyptic world. Also, another thing that this series did very well was making you to love a character who will die in the same episode.

Everything I said in this review was about the first season, of course; however, I have no doubt that for the second season it will still be the same piece of art that it was this first season.

Quite a ride!"

This has translated brilliantly in this faithful adaption and what amazed me was that despite knowing what was coming in many parts the show still managed to deliver tension. Overall for those who are new to the last of us you will find a brilliant tale of redemption that unlike most western media does not necessarily have a clear binary perspective of good and bad. Beautifully shot and acted the show is a revelation to both new and old fans. My guess is that in the post covid era this show seemed more apt, so it was greenlit and in any case the production has excelled. I have personally been a long time fan of Pedro Pascal and am pleased this show has broadcasted his talents to a wider audience. Bella Ramsay also performs to an equally high calibre and you wouldn't even guess she is of English origin. Highly recommended."

But in their defence they would have had a limited budget for a brand new show. And it gave them the ability to be able to delve in to the characters more. Now that it's broken all records I imagine they'll get a bigger budget. And the makers have already said they will have more infected and action in season 2.

8/10

There are a few twists here and there but the show will pretty much go as you expect it to go - even if you're not familiar with the plot and never played the game before.

It was a bit stretchy every now and then. And since it's based on a game, then expect it to be unrealistic. I mean zombies are unrealistic yes, but there will be gun fights that are way too exaggerated.

Without giving out any spoilers, but there's going to be like a few ""1 vs 100"" gunfights and yeah you guessed it, the ""1"" will come out as the victor. Stuff like that are cool in video games, not so much in tv shows and movies.

And I think most of us can agree that there's ONE filler episode, that was completely unnecessary. They could've used that episode for something much better.

And at last - this may be an unpopular opinion - but I never got to like the actress who plays Ellie. There's just something about her that's annoying. I personally think they could've selected a better actress for Ellie's role. But she did okay. Again just my opinion, you don't have to agree.

Anyways after all that ranting, then it was a pretty good watch. I'd definitely recommend it. But don't expect it to be too much different than The Walking Dead or other zombie tv shows."

I was hoping there would be more episodes similar to when they are ambushed and have to fight their way out of town. Those are the scenes that made the game great.

The show tried to move the story forward with flashbacks, which I feel didn't work. They would follow up an action packed scene or episode that left you wanting more with a slow, drawn out flashback. The pacing was off.

I feel like the final episode was too short. It felt like a quick summary of the end. They just rolled credits and leave you asking, ""That's it?"""

Actors & Actress and Acting: well, the cast was not the best one, in my humble opinion. They have not that many facial expression, and that's a shame as this show (game) was mainly psychological, so facial expressions are very important.

Visual Effects: a very good part of the show. I also loved the part were they showed the classic Bloater kill in the background.

Soundtrack: very good, very near the level of the game. Totally loved it.

Conclusion: not at the level of the game (well, maybe because of the fact that the game you actually live it) and it's way different (only the main flow was kept), but in conclusion, as always, HBO didn't deluded. The cast was meh and, as someone else rightfully said, the pace of this show was wrong, too many things were cut out and that's totally a shame."

Permalink";"Despite having a big dislike for Part II's ending, having a mixed reaction towards the casting of its two lead actors, and the fact that this is a videogame adptation, HBO's The Last Of Us has broken away from the long tradition of mediocre videogame adaptations by being both a faithful and innovating retelling of an iconic tale.

Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey shed new light on Joel and Ellie's relationship bringing both more emotion and depth to these characters. Ramsay especially feels like she did her homework. The same way that we now see Robert Downey Jr. As the definitive version of Iron Man, Ramsey is videogame Ellie brought to life. She's that good and her role deserves all the recognition.

It took me 4 episodes to get a feel of what Pedro Pascal was bringing to his own take on Joel. Instead of the strong silent hero type stereotypically portrayed in most videogames, Pascal chose to focus on Joel's humanity and deep anxiety which illustrated a whole new side to the character that couldn't have possibly been portrayed as well in a the game. That's not to say that Joel is not as able or as violent in this version, he's simply portayed in a much more realistic fashion.

The supporting cast is also terrific and I appreciate that they didn't just cast actors based solely on their acting abilities but also took the chance to cast minorities. Standout performances incluse Lamar Johnson, Keivonn Montreal Woodard, Storm Reid, Nico Parker and Scott Shepherd. These actors were able to bring the characters in the game to life and, in my opinion, delivered masterful performances, which is quite a feat.

The scale and the sets of the project are insane. It astounds me that HBO was able to allow these guys to do whatever they wanted, and it paid off. The locations, cinematography, costume design and lighting are gorgeous masterpieces. Most Hollywood productions would kill to be able to work on this kind of project.

All in all, The Last Of Us is a win win. If you're new to this story you get to experience it for the very first time. Lucky you. If you are a fan of the games you will be eagerly anticipating how the show will adapt your favourite moments. It's must watch tv."

Episode 3 was just totally misplaced and made no sense, although I must admit I've never played the game, so who knows.

Every other episode has been crammed full of cliches it's been unbearable. I have watched them all but only because there was nothing else on, and I had the forlorn hope that it might get better.

I can't believe all the positive reviews, each to their own I suppose but for me it has been so disappointing, and almost embarrassing at times.

Ah well I live in hope that something as good as Breaking Bad or the Ozarks arrives soon."

All the TV series had to do was be consistent with the game's story and it failed to do so on many levels. We almost get to spend same amount of time with every character yet they all lack certain depth. As the episodes progresses we can feel the story being rushed. Video editors did a horrible job of cutting and shortening certain intense scenes. They gave depth and character to the over all arc and the world but failed to fit the characters in it. Characters were given filler stories, just to extend the episode. HBO seemed like tightening the budget episode by episode. Characters appear later in episode did not had that kind of chemistry. Audience had to agree on certain scenes on the threat of being cancelled. Episode 3, 4, most of 5, and 7 were just filler episodes. We can cut them down and still it wont effect the series because its already tasteless. Dont jump on the hype train After Episode its a downhill."

Permalink";"I really got into this and liked it more than most series. Joel and Ellie grew on me as the characters developed. I liked the different ways that different groups adapted to post-apocalyptic survival. A lot of reviewers didn't like the ""filler"" episodes like Bill's story and the night the girls spent at the mall. But I liked both of them! Especially how Bill's prepping wasn't as stupid as it seemed in The Before. This isn't a perfect series for sure. Tommy's community is too good to be true. A lot of the episodes dragged. And some factual stuff was way off....giraffes couldn't survive Salt Lake City winters, for example. And problems like ""gas being mostly water"" after 20 years come and go conveniently. But overall well done and I'm looking forward to Season 2. And like all post-apocalyptic stories it makes me value canned goods in a new way."

Permalink";"I wish it bit longer, I guess I can start with that, thats the only negative thing I can think about it, that there was room for more episodes, but that aside story was still executed very good, everything from casting, acting, writting, cinematography, everything was beautiful, very few low points, pacing was good for almost all episodes expect maybe one but even then, all episodes on their own tell a great story and make this show just as the game, one of a kind.

It earned every bit of praise and good ratings and my recommendation for everyone to watch it.

It was fantstic watch, and I am looking forward to watch season 2.

Rating is 9/10 only because of pacing and because there was room for more episodes in season, or doing it in 2 seasons, I think if that was done then I wouldn't even have issue with feeling that some things could be bit better, and then I would gladly give this show 10/10 to go with few others who have that rating for me.

Still again, thats just small nit picking, maybe personal feeling, subjective, overall show is great and you should watch it!"

Permalink";"As a lot of people, I played the game some years ago, and it is one of those art pieces that leaves you thinking, that impacts so much you keep to remember certain moments of it for a long time. We know how the industry has behaved in previous efforts of adapting videogames to television, being the final result acceptable at best, and an absolute catastrophe at worst. But when you enter into this show, even in the first few minutes, you have the comforting sensation that you are watching somethin interesting, well-developed, something that respects the source material and adapts to the screen as needed, and that sensation doesn't do anything but grow on you with the passing of the episodes. You can feel cruelty, guilt, sadness, desperation, of a world that collapsed against an enemy that could not be defeated. But you also experience hope, love, happiness, as if you were playing the game once more, and here comes again the respect that the creators had for the source material, added to the fantastic interpretations by all the show's cast, especially (and here there are no surprises) by Bella Ramsey, who portraits a perfect Ellie. The main point that reinforces my opinion here is that the show creates the best atmosphere for imperfect characters. It is not a story of heroes and villains, of good people and bad people, but of different groups of human beings who get to the limits of what's good and bad in order to survive. And that cannot be accomplished perfectly without good acting and a good screenplay.

However, there are two minor issues, from my perspective, which don't let the show reach perfection. On one side, we have the surprising absence of infected in the majority of the episodes, which were more focused on the human conflicts (which is comprehensible, don't get me wrong, but at the end of the day, we are in an apocalyptic world); on the other side, I feel that the relationship between Joel and Ellie would have needed 2 or 3 more episodes to be really believable by the end of the season. It felt a bit pushed, specially towards the last two episodes.

Nevertheless, HBO created a magnificent piece of work, which is an honorable heir of the game's legacy."

Permalink";"I should say straight away that I've never played the games that this series is based on so I'm judging it solely on how it comes across as a series.

I held off watching this because the amount of hype around it just was far too much for me to believe.

I watched episode 1. I thought it was ok and decided to watch another.

Episode 2. Ok things seem to be moving along in an interesting way even if some parts are incredibly obvious.

Episode 3. Actually really enjoyed the episode but it really didn't connect to the first 2 episodes and felt like it could of just been a totally separate me vie of its own.

After that it just went further and further downhill. Rolled my eyes at episode 4, shook my head at episode 5, struggled to get through episode 6, gave up when episode 7 just became a teen drama.

Pick a lane.

Dismissed."

The post epocalyptic world has some diverse communities our heroes have to navigate and that is put forward instead of zombie platter. The two main characters (who are main in the true sence) are played extremely well compared to the original game. Camera and sound is flawless.

The episoder are sometimes scrambled in time as to give backstories and explanation to the main characters origin in relationto the story told. This gives a sence of delibirate writing and storytelling where every detail is explained through the backstopry of each character. It is not pretty - far from it.

Permalink";"The last of us, is a video game adaption. This is often something that leads to bad media on the big and small screen, but that is definitely not the case here. This show is truly brilliant. For fans of the game, it adds some changes (that in my opinion improve the show) to the story that add further depth, and a slightly different experience than placing the game. For new fans, this is a great show and great story that will inevitably lead to a great multi season show.

My favourite episode of the show; episode 3, can be watched (and I have suggested it to multiple friends) as a standalone movie. The love story between bill and frank is quite different to the game, but is an awesome example about how differing slightly from the source material can end in amazing stories (At least with this show)."

You also had characters that were so poorly written, (such as Kathleen), dialogue that is so awful, that I'm genuinely surprised these people have jobs.

If you try to visit the aftershow podcast in an attempt to ascertain why they wrote the things they did, you will be none the wiser. Their ""themes"" that they inject and explain are about as complex as my nephew's elementary English class.

It's also a shame that, like he did with Part II in the game, they deflect any legitimate criticism as ""homophonic internet trolls."" That is not the case. Brokeback Mountain was well-written. This is not."

Permalink";"Coming from a big fan of The Last of Us video game, I'd say this is the best video game adaptation to ever be made. The story of The Last of Us is not only about zombies and fighting them but also about the lives of people that have been disrupted for 20 years after a zombie outbreak. The Last of Us shows us how beautiful and dangerous love can be. Keeping this in mind, the show runners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann knew what they were doing while adapting the game for TV (Neil was also the writer and creative director of The Last of Us video game). They kept the story as close as they could to the game while diverting and expanding upon the world when required. The casting was well done. Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey did an exceptional job bringing Joel and Ellie to life for the TV show.

Keeping the game in mind, every aspect of this show, from the cinematography to the editing, set design, music, and special effects, was top-notch. The show starts powerfully and ends powerfully, with everything in the middle being as good as the game. HBO's The Last of Us is an outstanding TV show that always keeps its viewers on their toes."

Coming on acting, that little girl, yeah she will took your full attention and you will completely get connected to her. About Pedro Pascal, I don't have any words and even giving 10/10 stars for his work is less. After this also, some character were which throw up for only 1 episode through the series, but i cry for them, specially Henry and Sam named character. Coming on last episode, i wanted more. 43 min was not enough at all. That little thing disappointed but still whole series gonna be closed permanently to my heart.

Overall i want to tell that please don't miss this series ever. Each episode of this series carried important rule to connect with them. And appreciation work from team who work behind the camera. Waiting for next season and I will be with full of excitement and high hope in this."

The first episodes seemed ok enough to keep me going, but I found Ellie pretty unlikable from the beginning and my understanding was she was supposed to be the softer more endearing character. From then on the show just got worse to me. The Bill/Frank episode was completely useless to the core story, and just felt like a love story shoved into an apocalyptic world where only 5% of it even dealt with the apocalypse.

The rest of the episodes failed to change my engagement with the main characters. I never felt invested in their story, or even cared if they servived. Each episode spent only a few minutes on the actual journey, and spent most of the time of the ""main event"" of the episode which never allowed the show to breathe and truly feel like a long journey for these characters. It seemed like them walking across the continental US only took them a week (vs 1883 which felt like a true journey across months of time).

Episode 8 was the first episode that was gripping and engaging, where I actually cared if Ellie made it and was vested in her outcome. But then the series finished with episode 9 which was an incredible let down. It all seemed to end so quickly, the stand off with Joel and the Fireflies was underwhelming and poorly shot IMO. By the end I felt like I just wasted an hour of my evening.

Production quality was decent which is why I gave it a 6. But the story and the characters were mediocre at best. Lame."

Two (!) Filler-episodes (3+7) in the first season that add absolutely no value to the plot and probably only serve ideological (promoting LGBT) purposes, a very slow pace with hardly any action, a terrible actress as a cast member for ELLIE.

This series is a negative example of how to turn an amazing story of a video game into a boring series while destroying the chemistry, authenticity and sympathy of the characters. The plot in the game is dense, its action driven and atmospheric, you feel with the characters and are involved in the story. You care about them. Here, I wish that Ellie would just die as she is nothing more than annoying and unable to portray any emotions besides this.

Too bad, I had such high expectations after Chernobyl...."

Without spoiling anything, what I love about the show is that the main characters are not perfect. They have flaws and their choices are not one sided. They are not ""good"". In this harsh alternative reality people have to make, well, harsh choices, and while Ellie and Joel try to do their best at making moral and ethically good decisions, it doesn't always work out.

The show is perfectly understamdable and enjoyable without having played the game."

I never felt on the edge of my seat as it didn't seem like they were really in danger much of the time. I don't expect it to be just like the game and I appreciate that, but there needed to be more infected.

There is less action and the violence is toned down, but I think that was to be expected, because seeing frequent action and violence would get a little boring in live action.

Episodes 1-3 are very strong. There are some people who don't like episode 3, but I don't really understand them. Episodes 4-7 were a little shaky for me (besides a great action sequence in episode 5). Episode 7 was particularly rough; I think that and the character of Kathleen were the two main misfires (she's just not a particularly strong leader; I buy Marlene and David as leaders of their respective groups, but not Kathleen). Thankfully, episodes 8 and 9 bring it all home strong. I am curious about how season 2 will look; that's not a game I've played, but I'm quite familiar with the narrative and why it's controversial.

The production value's excellent. Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey are both consistently great in the lead roles. I think most of the changes to the game work well. I'm not a huge fan of the middle chunk of episodes, and they really hold it back overall, but still, the first season of The Last of Us starts and ends strong. I think it's pretty easy to recommend to most people, whether they're fans of the game or not."

However, as more information came out - Druckmann being heavily involved, casting decisions, budget, etc - I began to get my hopes up. Having now finished season 1, I'm happy to say I quite enjoyed this adaptation. It's not perfect, but it's a very faithful and well done series that has left me eagerly anticipating season 2.

Permalink";"An Emotional Adventure

Pros - The Last of Us takes place in post apocalyptic zombie world where people are affected by the fungi called Cordyceps which is present in our real world too . Cordyceps concept itself created literal chills and fear at the starting of the series . I actually expected full paced Horror adventure , but it turns out to be an emotional adventure with subtle amount of action , horror and thriller . Characters and their characterisation were well written , especially Father-Daughter relationship between Joel and Ellie was soul of the series . There were other characters which created quite impact eventhough they appear in one or two episode . Cast did a great job , especially Pedro Pascal as Joel and Bella Ramsey as Ellie delivered an incredible performance .

Direction was good and realistic . In technical aspect brilliant work , Visual effects , CGI and cinematography were top notch . Background scores were well composed .

Cons - Series contain two filler episodes . Yes , it only barely contributes to the main plot but somehow even in filler it tries to be genuine . No other major drawbacks .

Overall , good post apocalyptic emotional adventure . Don't expect a fast paced horror thriller . Be ready for the heart breaking moments .

Highly recommended ."

However, the creators did an amazing job of being faithful to the game and I think a lot of media companies can learn from this. The first episode in its entirety was an excellent introduction into the world of the last of us. The beginning interview talking about pandemics on the talk show was an excellent hook.

My only critique is I feel like it was pretty rushed in many parts, seeing as we really only had 7 episodes of Joel and ellie. I wish the season had been a few episodes longer but I imagine they wanted to play it safe. Definitely not a show for everyone as the concept is pretty crazy but I am very pleased with the outcome."

Permalink";"I played the game years ago, and while I don't remember a lot of the specifics, I recognize that so much of the show as basically a copy paste of scenes from the game. The bits that are added do well to expand on the world and the stories it's telling which helps make up for some of the missing gameplay sections. The acting across the board is terrific, the effects and locations are great, and the pervasive sense of desperation is palpable. A few episodes in I was ready to join the online masses in declaring this not only the best video game adaptation, but the best show on right now.

But as the show progressed I started to notice there were big chunks of connective tissue missing. The quiet moments in the game where you walk around an abandoned city were gone and it started to feel like watching a supercut of all the dramatic scenes. There were great moments and great episodes, but it wasn't coming together to form a cohesive, great season and I can't help but think a couple more episodes would have really helped with pacing. I can't give specifics without spoiling anything, but as an example the effects of trauma are quickly pushed aside as the characters push on when it really should have been dealt with over time. And I have to point out the ending, the same as the game's, which completely undermines everything that came before it.

A lot of people have praised the game for its effective storytelling and moral philosophy, and I always got hung up on that ending as the wrong way to wrap up this story. We have spent so much time with these people, particularly Joel, and watched him change and grow, so to throw all that away sours the entire experience. Having lived through a pandemic now, it's even more frustrating that I suddenly hated the character for his selfishness. I don't know where in the creative process that ending came to them, but in the course of writing the story, they didn't take the time to earn it."

Permalink";"As a long running TLOU fan, I can say that this show is one I've been looking forward to for a long while. I feel like most gripes that people had with the original game were gameplay issues, but the story was more than enough to leave an impact on the industry that is still felt today. That kind of story deserves to be justified in a place that even more people can experience it, and that is EXACTLY what they've done here, making it both an amazing ride for people who have never experienced this story, and adding enough flesh onto the bones of the world they've created to excite those who are familiar with it, while still TRULY honoring the source material. Congratulations to Craig Mazin and Neil Druckman for the monumental task that they undertook and achieved, and to the amazing cast and crew that made that vision come to life. You guys have done something no one thought could be done!"

Permalink";"Maybe it is in the human's nature, to find something in your life to live for. Whether it is family, friends, you want to find something to keep going, even in the face of an apocalypse.

That is what the Last of Us keep exploring.

I played the game, a long time ago, yet the emotions from the story remained. It was crafted beautifully. It was not just a scary zombie game but inside, it is filled with intricate stories about human's connection.

The series closely follow the game. There are some changes like the Bill and Frank's story (which made it better and definitely and stand out in a tv series. Finally no kill your gays trope), and it really takes you high and low.

Pedro and Bella were casted wonderfully. They were both a delight to watch.

My only complain is the series is a little bit short. Maybe we need another 2 episodes. I'm not ready to say goodbye yet and I would like to see more teamwork of Joel and Bella. Their connection is there but I want to see more of their connection, instead of just snippets.

Shoutout to Mindhunter's veteran Anna Torv and all the original cast from the game.

Gustavo's music is a delight too. Wonderful work as always. I will miss hearing it every Sunday.

Now please remake Uncharted. We need a proper Nathan Drake."

Permalink";"Based on the well known video game of the same name and adapted for television by Craig Mazin (Chernobyl, Hangover pt II), we follow Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) as they travel across the US 20 years after a zombie apocalypse has broken out. With a surprising amount of characters for a show primarily about two people, this first season really made me appreciate how under-utilized Pedro Pascal has been in the Mandalorian so far, he really plays a phenomenal, nuanced character in these sorts of roles. Ramsey was Ellie was good, and the rest of the cast suited fine, and for a character driven series most felt realistic at least to a degree that didn't take me out of the story. I often found myself asking ""where's the gameplay?"" until of course any shooting scene or scene moving furniture / ladders around, there are scenes that certainly feel straight out of a game. That's not to fault it, it was of course a game, so I think works for the most part, however I found myself not believing much of the grander overarching plot more as the series progressed. The zombies were well designed, but the factions and political drama got to be a bit much. I get it, humans are the real bad guys, but with a lot of commentary on what it means to be good, and how most of us are just trying to keep living, I found myself continually engaged but often questioning motivations. If you loved the games (I have yet to play them), or you like this sort of post-apocalyptic narrative I would certainly recommended. Was good, will watch part II."

Superb script, magnificent, breathtaking acting, beautiful cinematography, visual effects that perfectly make up the universe, perfect adaptation that brings equal parts of the game that are relevant and additions that only enhance the story.

Even believing that everything was amazing, some things stood out more. Bella deserves an emmy now, stop everything and give this actor the award. What a performance! The chemistry, the mechanics of Ellie and Joel's relationship were so well built, you want to live through the apocalypse just to be with them. And another thing that impressed a lot was the ability to introduce fleeting characters in such a brilliant way, that you fall in love or loath them so vicerally in a short period of time. It's insane!

I only have one thing to say: if you know someone who doesn't like this tv show, run away because the person is infected with the fungus."

Permalink";"The first season of The Last of Us is a masterpiece of post-apocalyptic storytelling that will leave you wanting more. There is hardly anything to complain about, except for maybe the slight absence of the infected. However, this is a minor quibble when you consider the fantastic adaptation of the game, which seamlessly blends game elements with original ideas, stories and the history of the characters.

One of the most impressive aspects of the show for me is its stunning cinematography, which beautifully captures the desolate, haunting world of the post-apocalypse. The costumes and makeup are also noteworthy, adding a layer of realism to the show that truly immerses you in this dystopian landscape. But what truly makes The Last of Us so remarkable, in my personal opinion, is its cast of characters, brought to life by a talented ensemble of actors. In particular, the relationship between Joel and Ellie is a standout, with the two characters forming an unlikely bond that is both heartwarming and heart-wrenching. Joel, a stubborn and gruff survivor, becomes the reluctant protector of Ellie, a young girl and he is willing to sacrifice the whole world for her.

Despite the absence of the infected, The Last of Us is a series that deserves ten stars (decided to subtract a star because of the infected). The other aspects of the show, including its exceptional writing, outstanding acting, and captivating cinematography, more than make up for any minor flaws. If you're a fan of post-apocalyptic fiction or just great storytelling in general, The Last of Us is a must-watch. Get ready to be transported to a world unlike any other, where survival is the ultimate goal and the only thing that matters is the bond between those who are left."

I love the casting choices, the cinematography and the music. I would also highly recommend the HBO's The Last of Us podcast on Spotify. There is a podcast episode about every episode of the show and you can very clearly see all the love and passion that went into making this series. I really hope they continue to do that with future seasons. Overall I love the series."

Permalink";"Episode 3 is excellent; deviating from the plot of the game, it is a highly original and touching story. The writers should have binned the rest of the series and made a feature film of episode 3, for the rest of the show suffers from many of the issues with mainstream American drama more broadly. Namely, endless exposition, pointless dialogue, filters that add a veneer of artificiality. It feels like a lot of money was spent on it, but little else. The relationship between the two characters - i.e. The essence of the story - is absent. Watch episode 3 in isolation, then play the game if you want to explore the story further."

They drive cars as if they werent wanted by EVERYONE.

Roads are easily passable after 20yrs.

They chit chat all the time out on the road as if they aren't at risk of zombie/scavenger attack, but just a couple of people wandering about in a civilized land governed by law.

Someone should have a weapon in hand at all times, preferably one that is relatively silent, guns should be a last resort...

It is incredibly well casted, extremely well written and not only stays true to the source material, but also improves upon it. Whether you are a die hard fan of the Last of Us Video Game or have never even played the game let alone heard of the characters, this is a must watch simply because at its core it's a beautifully written and well executed story from start to finish. Its very rare to experience a project that is based off of a video game, novel or play and see it come to life so naturally and that is NOT just a simple cash grab for an easy IP.

I usually like to enjoy binging shows because I like the idea of having all episodes available to explore and revisit when I choose, however I throughly enjoyed the long progression each episode took so I could properly digest each and every episode the week it came out. In conclusion I guarantee you will be missing out if you don't partake in this beautiful masterpiece."

Permalink";"I just got done watching all 9 episodes of The Last of Us and wanted to give my full review on the first season. So first off, HBO has definitely got another win on their hands with this show. It is unlike any other apocalypse show I've ever seen and unlike anything that's ever been made. The fact that the actual game developers were heavily involved with the making of this show is part of why this show has paid off big time. Pedro Pascal as the lead character Joel was a dream casting come true as a smuggler with a dark past in a apocalyptic world who is tasked with getting a young girl named Ellie across the country west who might be the key to saving humanity in exchange for help to find his brother Tommy. Ellie played by Bella Ramsey absolutely owns this role as the young girl with a past of her own who is just now experiencing and exploring the apocalyptic world for the first time while making a connection with her new found protector Joel. The chemistry between Ellie and Joel in the show is so on point and is very much like how the video game portrayed the two together as well. The way Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey do portray the characters though, is in a way that doesn't make people think they're just mimicking the game, but bringing their own sense or versions of the characters to the show which is why I loved how they both were portrayed here. It made me care for the two characters that I've come to love even more in this live action adaptation. The set designs I have to say are some of the best I've ever seen to come from HBO or any television series period. They really made this show just like how the video game is. Especially when it comes to how the infected are portrayed. The rest of the cast was great as well in their own ways too. I kinda wish we gotten a little more of Nick Offerman's character Bill like how we got him in the games, but I was satisfied in the end with how HBO handled his character. Troy Barker who is the original voice of Joel in the game who also plays James in show I was glad to see make a appearance. As well as Ashley Johnson who was the voice of Ellie in the games, but played Ellie's mom in the show. I think they both executed their roles well being Easter Eggs for fans of the games. Overall, this is probably one of my favorite projects to come from HBO and one that I will be more than happy to revisit in the future as this is one of the greatest video game adaptations I've ever seen with the help of its two leading characters, a great story, and fantastic set designs. Rating 10/10."

I give this a 10 out of 10 because i love the game, i love the fallout series, i love the walking dead (without the cliche), i love Resident Evil series, 28 days and weeks later!

The last of us, gets the vibe exactly right as your tears roll down your cheek, making you feel humane again... even if it's just for a little while to get back out there into the apocalypse.

Danger lurking in the shadows, deception on the prowl and maybe a cure to all this madness?!

Subscribe to HBO, it's worth more than you actually pay for. <3.

PS: Chapeau to all the cast playing magnificent roles even the tiniest ones. To the special effects team and decor management, the amazing CGI backdrops which look incredibly realistic and the tensed feeling each scene handles with the uttermost care from the directors point of view.

Permalink";"So first of all, this is a fantastic show and one of the better new shows of the past couple of years. If you couldn't already tell by my rating for some reason, I really enjoyed the show through and through. It is just unfortunate that some choices held back this show from perfection.

But I will first do the praises and talk about what's so good about the show and then I'll get to the problem I have with it.

So first of all, obviously, the acting in this show from everyone (except maybe for Kathleen) is fantastic and Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey are the stars of the show. Bella Ramsey got a lot of unwarranted backlash for her being cast as Ellie just because she didn't look as close to the character. But she definitely proved why she was a really good choice for it.

The show's premise and story are nothing you've never seen before. It would've been fairly original and fresh in 2013, especially for video games, but it still tries to make itself more unique and more distant from your average zombie story which I thought worked out really well. But there are still tropes and stories here you already know, so nothing that groundbreaking and original here. (Though not that this show has to be groundbreaking or anything,)

But this show does a great job as a live-action video game adaptation and I think it's safe to say that this is the best video game adaptation to date.

The production is just top-notch and aside from the occasional obvious green screens (and that's only if you're really zooming on it to find a flaw), the visual, CGI, and makeup are just top-notch and I really enjoyed this aspect of the show that they didn't cut corners on the set design and makeup for the zombies and the special effects for the rundown post-apocalyptic world of this show. The production value is really high and the visuals are just fantastic and they don't cheap out on not showing the run-down cities and ruins.

The music is mostly the same pieces from the game, especially the intro music, which I have zero problems with and I'm actually glad that they kept it for the show too because it's a fantastic piece. But the rest are mostly licensed music which are really good choices too for the show, but I don't think I noticed that much original new music for the show itself other than the finale. But still, no problem with it, just an observation.

They didn't screw this video game adaptation like dozen others by ruining the world, the characters, and the story. This show is mostly shot-for-shot recreation of the game, at least for the more iconic scenes, and I have zero problems with it. They do a really great job of keeping what best worked in the game and adapting to the live-action and adding and changing things to improve and maybe a little worsen it.

Though I must say I've never played the game, but I have watched a full walkthrough of it many years ago, but my recollection of the story only extends to the intro and the ending of it. So I'm not really reviewing this show from the perspective of someone who has played the game and knows the story well or trying to compare it.

Overall, I think everything in this show, apart from the writing which I'll get to it in a second, is top-notch and I really enjoyed watching it, and made me excited to play the remake when it comes to PC. I just wish I binged this show instead of watching it weekly though, because of the problem I'm gonna talk about now. And also, if you binge the show, you'll notice these problems and the rushedness of the story.

So the praising and the goods aside, let's get into what I have a problem with in this show and what I think hinders the show from being greater.

First, the second biggest problem in my opinion is Neil Druckmann's boner for flashbacks. This guy loves his flashbacks so much that he dedicated two full episodes of this show to them. He would make a whole movie and series that is just 99% flashbacks if you gave him full control. I just don't understand this guy's fascination with flashbacks and why he thinks it's a really good storytelling tool. I don't really have much against flashbacks, I don't care for them, but I don't hate hate them either. But when there are such big amounts of flashbacks in your story that it hurts the main storyline, then I have a beef with it.

If you're telling a story, you characterize your characters and develop them through your main storyline and plot. You don't flashback every 5 minutes so we could see what they did a couple of years ago. Sometimes flashbacks are a necessary tool to give your character more depth and I definitely prefer flashbacks to ""tell don't show"". But having entire 1-hour episodes dedicated to flashbacks, and then your main plotline getting 40 minutes is not it.

Now I think they did a great job with episode 3 and the only problem I had with it was that it wasn't more connected to the present plotline that makes one think what was even the point and it was a filler.

But comparing episode 3 to episode 7, you can see that they actually had something in episode 3 that they didn't have for episode 7. They actually told a really good story in episode 3 with good characters and great actors, and it was interesting enough to warrant a whole episode. But they didn't have enough material and also an interesting enough story to dedicate an entire episode to what we got in episode 7. I don't have a problem with them flashbacking to Left Behind which is a DLC of the game, I just think it would've worked better if the flashback and the main story moved side-by-side and the story didn't halt because we have to watch an hour of flashbacks now. That's the problem with these kinds of flashbacks, they halt the main story which is already barely developed to tell another story.

This leads to my biggest problem with the show, which is how rushed the story is, and the flashback episodes might be culprits.

Even though I don't remember much from the game, it is still obvious to me that they skipped a lot of plotlines to just do the main big events and be done with it. Most side characters don't even stay for two episodes, they are introduced in the episode, and they are killed at the end of that episode, apart from some other side characters that survive two or three episodes.

But my point is, what's the rush, and what's the point of putting this much effort into the great production and set designs and makeup and all the effort they put into making the show, just to rush through the story and skip on actual development?

This show would've been way better if we got more Joel and Ellie time and maybe not just jumping into the next plot point quickly without effective buildup and development. Hell, I even thought I skipped an episode when I started watching the finale since everything happened so fast and they don't really convey the sense of time. The last episode is so short that they could've skipped a little from the first part of it and attached the rest to the last episode to get a longer finale since they like skipping this much.

And I think most of these decisions are most probably because of budget restraints and this is probably the best thing could've come up with to compromise. But then again, they still could've put all that effort and budget that went into episode 7 (which I guess was cheaper than other episodes anyway since it was all indoors), and developed the main storyline more.

Another annoying thing they do is the fake-outs. Well, they're not technically fake-outs but I don't know what to call the trope. It's when they don't show someone getting bitten until after it happens. It's just a cheap trick for a ""twist"" and surprise that gets old really quickly.

The first time it happens it's great and works well for the story and characters. It's a great emotional gut punch. The second time is whatever. But doing it again and again? What's the point of it if you're gonna show it 10 seconds later? And also characters not knowing they've got bitten for some reason as if they can't feel being bitten? And don't give me that adrenaline crap because they would definitely feel it if they were getting bitten in the middle of fighting.

I don't have a problem if they do it once or twice, but doing it so much just cheapens the effect and becomes comical. They deliberately refuse to show them getting bitten or react to them until the reveal.

It reminds of another example of this that was in Moon Knight, which they just actually skipped action and not showed what happened. Literallly skipped the action even in the finale. It's just baffling. Also reminds of the Uncharted movie where things just magically teleport into the thieves' pockets and you have to believe they ""stole"" because the script says so, even though the two people didn't even get close to each other.

Another relatively small problem I had with the show is the character Kathleen and how the show's writers try to portray her and actually the actress they chose for it. Since I haven't seen her anywhere else before, I cannot say if her acting is bad or the casting director made a mistake, or she was intentionally miscast and misdirected on how to act as this character by the showrunner. But I won't get into it much, I think you can find many other reviews on the episodes she was in and see why people had a problem with her character.

Other than these couple of issues, I don't think I had much of a problem with the show as a whole and I enjoyed it overall, and though I think with these storytelling and writing problems, it's probably an 8/10, I'm still giving it a generous 9/10 since they performed a miracle by not totally fking up a video game adaptation beyond recognition and actually delivered the best video game adaptation ever, which is an achievement in itself."

Permalink";"First I'm going to state a few biases/preferences: 1) I love movies (always have), but I hate video games (always have). I knew nothing of this one.

2) I prefer character-based drama and comedy, in which plot points hardly matter, except to the extent they reveal more about the characters. I liked both of the main characters in this series.

3) Unlike a lot of reviewers, I didn't dislike Bella Ramsey's portrayal of Ellie. Unlike some others, I *did* like Pedro Pascal's turn playing Joel. (I first noticed him a few years ago in the Netflix series ""Narcos."" Check that out to see his impressive acting range.) Good support was provided here by Anna Torv, the star of ""Fringe,"" as Tess, Lamar Johnson as Henry, and Nick Offerman as Bill.

4) If not for the post-episode commentaries, I wouldn't have known that Merle Dandridge, who played Marlene in the series, had voiced the same character in the video game a decade ago, or that the woman who had voiced Ellie in the game, Ashley Johnson, would be playing Ellie's mother, Anna, in the series. Both stood out.

The reviews seem pretty well divided between ""a flawless masterpiece"" and ""a woke piece of crap."" I come in at neither end of the spectrum, but a bit closer to the former than to the latter. And in direct defiance of most reviewers, one of my favorite episodes was the so-called ""filler"" episode that featured Offerman (gamers refer to anything not directly from the video game's plot ""filler,"" based on 2 mediums being identical🤦🏻). The other one deemed ""filler,"" episode 7, wasn't as good, but not as bad as some would have it. Apparently, the meaning of ""woke"" is ""anything that puts hard-core conservatives to sleep."" I'm not sure if that meets the formal definition of ""ironic,"" but it meets my definition of ""idiotic.""

In conclusion, Season 1 of ""The Last of Us"" is about love, what it means to us humans, and the crazy, mixed-up, sometimes indefensible things that we are ultimately willing to do for/about it. If that sounds to you like a worthwhile subject, then you may like and be moved by this show. If that sounds too boring and not bloody enough to satisfy your expectation of adapting a game to series TV, then go ahead and skip this. 8/10."

Permalink";"Really 5 or maybe 6/10, a bare pass - but gets an extra point for Bella Ramsay playing Elly, and for the potential for the next season to be better, now that most of the cheesy (and unneccessarily long) back-stories are out of the way. For me, I would have preferred a cast with more regular characters, (at least not losing Tess so early), or a larger ""Party"" on the adventure, rather than now-you-see-them, now-you-don't NPCs.

Being an adaptation of a video game, some scenes, and whole episodes, do play out much like a game level, with focus on our 'players' winning a fight, rather than any significant plot movement or individual character growth.

Permalink";"""The Last of Us"" benefits from the talents of Craig Mazin, the brilliant creator who gave us ""Chernobyl."" If not for the level of care placed on production quality and top-notch acting talent, this zombie show could have easily been dismissed as just another ""The Walking Dead."" Fortunately, the ""Chernobyl"" influence permeates throughout, as this is a great series whether you are a fan of the video game or not. The dialogue, the ambience, the soundtrack, and especially the cinematography are all movie quality and yet this is just a TV show! What a treat. And we get bonus guest stars each week, my favorite of which is Murray Bartlett. Most of all, the success of the series relies heavily on the chemistry between the two main characters Joel and Ellie. The textured progression of their bond is utterly convincing and heartwarming, thanks to the nuanced performances by the perfect casting of Bella Ramsey and Pedro Pascal. They deserve all of the kudos. One pet peeve that is not quite making this 10 stars or ""Chernobyl"" level for me is the contrived ""saves at the last second."" Go easy on those and we'll have ourselves a true winner."

Permalink";"The long-awaited game-to-screen adaptation has finally arrived, and it's a triumph that not only pays homage to the source material but surpasses it in many ways. With Pedro Pascal embodying the role of Joel and Bella Ramsey delivering a remarkable performance as Ellie, the characters come to life in ways that transcend the original game.

The series delves deep into character development, presenting a more human and broken side to our beloved protagonists. The casting choices are spot-on, with each actor delivering a stellar performance that adds layers of depth to their respective characters.

From the well-crafted lines to the subtle Easter eggs strategically placed for future foreshadowing, the series expertly connects the narrative threads, weaving a story that aligns seamlessly with the events of Part II. The inclusion of additional storylines, such as Bill and Frank, adds richness to the series and enhances the development of the central relationship between Joel and Ellie.

However, while the adaptation excels in many aspects, it does play it safe at times. Some events feel rushed, and certain brilliant ideas are left unexplored, leaving viewers longing for a more in-depth exploration of the characters' intricacies.

A missed opportunity arises in the Sam and Henry episode, where the fear instilled in the audience during the underground encounter with clickers could have been amplified through Sam's deafness, creating a powerful contrast. Regrettably, this potential was left untapped.

The pacing of the episodes tends to be uneven, with a slow build-up in the beginning only to be followed by a rushed climax in the last 10 minutes. Nevertheless, the series shines brightest when it presents original moments, deviating from a strict replication of the game. Moments like Joel and Ellie's endearing banter in episode 4 and the cleverly executed men's magazine scene stand out as prime examples of the adaptation's brilliance.

Overall, this adaptation truly surpasses its gaming counterpart. It captures the essence of the characters, adds new dimensions to their stories, and excels in creating original moments that elevate the series to new heights. Despite a few shortcomings, it stands as a testament to the potential of game adaptations when done right."

Permalink";"I must admit before I go into my full review that I have not actually played the video game from whence the tv show comes. I have seen a few clips here and there so I knew what to expect as far as the visual design of the zombies and the basic plot. But other than that, I was going in pretty blind.

I figured right off the bat that The Last of Us would be similar to most other zombie shows with The Walking Dead being the poster child of the genre. Initially I was pleased within the first episode it covered much of the beginning of the apocalypse. Then it jumps 20 years into the future. This I feel was a wise choice. Rather than rehashing things we have all already seen in TWD and the like, we get to focus on the aftermath of the end of the world.

Unfortunately this intrigue quickly dies off after the first episodes. This show starts off with a bang, but almost immediately becomes soooo boring. The Last Of Us begins putting in filler episodes before we have even got off the ground. With each subsequent episode feelings more like an unrelated sitcom episode from the early 90s. Yes there is a broad overarching storyline tying them together but every episode has a beginning middle and end.. New characters are introduced each week only to have their stories and drama resolved within the same episode. What is the point? There is no intrigue episode to episode without using cheap ""cliffhanger"" moments to make you want to watch the next episode. It's 2023! I expect better writing than this. Especially from an HBO production, and especially given this show's plethora of source materials.

I have heard that people who have played the game are really enjoying the show .. and its current IMDb score would reflect that. But as someone who came in fairly blind, there is not enough substance to this show to keep me interested. If you want a good zombie show, watch The Walking Dead instead."

Permalink";"It started out great, the first episode had so much promise! Then it was mostly what felt like filler episodes between one or two randomly good episodes. Let's just say I'm not eagerly waiting each week for the next episode.... It's no GOT.

The first episode was a great start, but then you get one or two flash back episodes or even completely different characters stories. And some episodes with no zombies and very little action, which would be fine if it was some critical and informative episode. But it's not.... They just feel like filler episodes to make up for lack of action and budget.

I hate to stop watching, because I feel like they COULD turn it into something good. But if it does this next season I'm not going to watch at all.

And I'm way more interested in Pedro Pascals character than Ellie. I know this is based on a game, but let's be honest, he was the draw for people that don't game. We don't get enough of him."

Permalink";"As season one comes to a close and the first games story has finished, I can genuinely say this is the best live action video game adaptation, and one of the best constructed television series (or at least first seasons) of all time. The cinematography, acting, storytelling, visual effects, etc., were so beyond my expectations. Prior to the shows start, I'll admit I was one of the people skeptics of Bella's casting, but after seeing her more in the second episode I knew she was perfect as Ellie. All casting was spot-on in carrying the essence of the characters and becoming them. The way they took the game and expanded on it, while still being faithful and replicating so many important scenes was amazing. Some episodes were a bit slower than others in terms of pacing but nevertheless remained amazing. It's important to note that this is not a zombie show. This is a show about dealing with loss and grief. It's about humanity, and how people endure and survive. The Last of Us season one is an absolute masterpiece and I am so happy with how this show turned out."

Permalink";"Season 1:

While I may feel disappointment by this television adaptation. I am grateful that it introduced the greatest story gaming has ever told to a wider audience, an audience that never would have experienced or connected with it in its previous form.

The biggest problem that this series has is the pacing. With only nine episodes a lot of the story feels rushed, and certain important scenes or entire segments needed more time. Although to be fair, that may be the fault of HBO for not believing in Druckmann's stellar work.

Committing an entire episode to both the left behind dlc and Bill and Frank seems like a mistake in hindsight. While both episodes are great, they really take you out of the main story. We don't get as much quality Joel and Ellie time because of it. Part of why the game works so well is because you spend nearly 20 hours with these characters in the game. You connect with them, you feel as if you know them personally, you deeply care about them. All the small talk about movies, aspirations, and shared tragedy as you traverse desolate wastelands is what makes that game so incredible, and it's why the characters feel so real. In the show you spend less than half that time with these characters. This significantly takes a lot of the emotional oomph out of the story in my opinion.

Even some of the dialogue feels rushed. There are important and impactful lines that aren't allowed to breathe and sit in. A example of this was the dirty magazine scene where it sounds like Bella Ramsey is reading a checklist of lines from the game. The scene is funny, but also feels unnatural and a little stiff. Not to throw shade at Bella Ramsey, she has some truly great moments in this show.

If only this series got another one or two episodes, maybe then it could have fully done the game justice."

Permalink";"The Last of Us (2023) is a series that my wife and I finished tonight on HBOMAX. The storyline follows a post apocalyptic society after a virus outbreak spread across the globe. There are all types of deformities and mutations outside of the pockets of civilizations. An orphaned girl is found that may be the cure for the virus. A man with nothing to lose leads the orphan on a dangerous voyage to hopefully reach a group of scientists that can hopefully develop a cure.

This series was created by Craig Mazin (Chernobyl) and stars Pedro Pascal (Game of Thrones), Bella Ramsey (Game of Thrones), Anna Torv (Mindhunter) and Melanie Lynskey (Castle Rock).

The storyline and backdrop for this gave me ""The Walking Dead"" vibes. The variations of the infected was entertaining. You never really knew what was coming. The horror elements, special effects and intensity were all very good. The evolution of the characters and how they interacted was interesting, especially with how the season closed. The chemistry and performances by the entire cast is excellent. Pedro Pascal delivers a tremendous performance and Bella honestly annoyed me 😂...but she delivered a strong performance also. The writing is magnificent and I really enjoyed the side stories that played vital parts within the primary plot.

Overall, this is a perfect start to something that could be very good. I could see this being just the start to something much bigger and better down the road. I'd give this a 9/10 and strongly recommend it."

Pedro Pascal takes the reins as Joel, and Bella Ramsey as Ellie. For me, one of the most important factors going in was that the show cast had the blessing of the original talent from the game. This is a story about these two characters, and the directors do a fantastic job of always crossing back to Joel and Ellie, even after making a detour from their story into the lives of other characters. All in all, one of the rare few game to screen adaptations that not only follow the source material, but do the original story justice."

Permalink";"The first 2 episodes of The Last of Us were fantastic. They set up an interesting world and premise, interesting characters, particularly Ellie and Joel, and did a marvelous job of melding drama and game play. I felt like I was watching something new and groundbreaking. Unfortunately, the season didn't quite live up to the potential of those first episodes.

While each episode on its own was high quality, the transitions were often abrupt. Relationships were often under- or over-emphasized. For instance, episode three focuses on characters tangentially related to the story, but are never seen again. Episode 7 shows a tragic backstory that has already been told and spoiled throughout. Whole other episodes are dedicated to characters and situations that are temporary and incidental, but then characters that are meaningful and have important relationships to Ellie and Joel are glossed over.

The journey across the country was fast and abrupt. I think that the story and relationships, especially Joel and Ellie, needed more time and space to breathe and grow. I think it would also have been helpful to weave in more backstory, especially Joel. They mention his relationships with Tess and Bill, and Marlene and the Fireflies, but the scenes are fleeting and not very illuminating. Everything felt kind of like the last episode-it was excellent, but then just suddenly and unexpectedly ends.

I mention mostly negatives, but still found this entertaining. I just feel like this could have been so much more."

They should have gone for 10 or 12 episodes and have developed some parts of story a bit further. The last three or four episodes of the show feel pretty much rushed. But it's a pretty good show no matter what.

But now that season one (Part I) has ended we are faced with the big question mark regarding the second season that should follow Part II of the game and definitely won't be everyone's cup of tea or something easy to adapt for a broader audience. Fingers crossed."

So to all these people, a short reminder... 9 is Sopranos, The Wire, maybe Game of Thrones... not that.

The scale of shows doesn't really starts at 1 and ends at 10, it's more like 7 to 9, so 8 is smack in the middle.

It's not a new idea, has no incredibly tense or sophisticated plot and actually it's not clear where we go from here so, just enjoy it but, 9.1? Seriously???"

The actual horror or fright is non existent. Instead we get to watch gay soft pron or BLM doing their obligotary segment.

The issue is how forced this all feels. I found the episode with the gay couple refreshing in some ways, but it was entirely forced and driven by the MSM USA trend.

Apart from that, the acting is solid - a few annoying characters get killed off promptly.

The scenery and effects are high quality.

Sadly the repetitive forced representation becomes so incredibly tideous to watch."

Permalink";"Finally watching ""The Last of Us"" on HBO. Loved both console games. The show is good and decently accurate to the game. I feel like the casting choice for Ellie is slightly off, but nothing personal to the actress Bella Ramsey. A young Emma Watson would have been perfect sans the British accent.

Loved the episode/story of Bill and Frank, which the game didn't explain too much other than Joel's interaction with Bill after Frank had hung himself (in the game). Some parts of the TV show are literally recreations of game cut-scenes, such as the death of Joel's daughter and Ellie & Joel riding in Bill's truck as she checks out her first porno mag and tosses it from the vehicle.

I believe that HBO's selection of Bella Ramsey (as Ellie) is more about the 2nd season plot, which involves the controversial choice (to some) of Ellie being a lesbian. I can see her doing a good job in that role.... Just my thoughts/opinion.

Overall, good show and B-rating towards the video games accuracy. #mytwocents

What there is plenty tho is unbelievable narratives, terrible writing and dialogue, terrible plot holes and plot armor and finally diversity.

There is so much diversity that it just taints the whole creation, throwing even that little immersion you get out of the window.

Permalink";"The accuracy, faithfulness to the source material, and drama/action depiction of the game makes this adaptation perfect. HBO's The Last of Us at 97%-98% accurate and IS CANON. The reason why it is not 100% because there are subtle changes. Even though the changes are there, they still have the same outcome as told in the video game. What I like about the changes HBO made is they don't take away from the source material (lore), where as other video game adaptations stray so far off script they create their own story; diluting the source material and re-inventing a story from scratch.

The challenge I see with video game -to- live action adaptions is what content should be carried over. Include this amount of action? Include this amount of drama, etc. The game includes many more interactions with Clickers, and other oppositions Joel and Ellie encounter in the TV series. It is difficult to bring every single encounter, yet HBO found a balance. Doing it as a series and not a move is ideal because there is more opportunity to elaborate on parts of the story. There are some sequences that are not playable in the game; however, they are mentioned through newspaper articles, journal entries as Joel and Ellie travel, etc.

The art direction of the Clickers, the buildings, the landscapes, etc. Bring a nostalgia factor to when I played this game. The series in itself is giving me that feel that I want to re-visit the video game. People around me who are not gamers, bought the game to experience the cinematic experience of the game. That to me says a lot about how well this video game-to-live action was done."

I have not seen or heard of her before, but within the first few episodes she had proven herself to be - in my opinion - one of the greatest young actors out there. She is very believable which helps one to temporarily suspend reality and enjoy the story. Pedro Pascal is equally as talented and proficient, and together they make a capable team. The storyline is well-paced, unlike other drawn out zombie dramas (Yes, TWD) that consist of 15 episodes in a row of people whining while walking down railway lines. In TLOU, the characters' individual stories are actually weaved in to the narrative in a way that isn't too obnoxious or lengthy. What can I say, the script is good, the sets are well built, the costumes are well designed. Everything seems to have been beautifully refined. I can only hope that this doesn't go the way of the wonderful first season of Westworld and end up as the same pure trash. For now, it's very good."

Many people are raving about Pedro Pascal's performance (fair enough) and hating on Bella Ramsey's, as so often happens with male and female leads. Personally I think she has pitched it just right; she's playing a 14 year old and has absolutely the right level of annoyingness and resilience.

So far the most engaging show I've watched this year."

Is this censorship or merely a way to hide the budget for this show wasn't actually that high? I can see how a normie mainstream viewer would like this show but as someone who's beat the game twice, with the last time being right before the show premiered, i cannot condone this adaptation. I mean they literally told the cast not to play the game so they didnt understand the source material at all. Sound logic, right? Well it shows... If you are reading reviews on here to decide whether to watch the show or play the game: game all the day baby. Hell, i would recommend just watching a full gameplay video on youtube before i would tell someone to watch this lackluster re-imagining of the last of us."

But the last of us managed to break this barrier and produce a beautiful work of art. With all this pressure to make it as good as the game, I thought the show would fumble. The characters are human and aren't perfect which just makes it more interesting to watch. I also liked how the characters would do anything to protect what they care about. As another reviewer said the characters are ""selfishly unselfish"". The setting is great and the videography is astounding. Would definitely recommend."

I have never been so disappointed by an HBO series as this. I couldn't stay awake because it was so boring, irritating, forced and contrived. The script and acting were so inferior that it went straight into the streaming trash can. Even Pascale's performance was sub par. Avoid it like the plague or at least like a fungus. I never knew a series could take such a serious subject as a global pandemic and really succeed in undermining the seriousness of it. Shockingly poor writing, directing ,casting and acting."

Despite what the makers claim, this is just another zombie apocalipsis trash, with a small twist - it's not virus, but Cordiseps fungus that turns infected people into flesh-eating zombies. The production is awesome though, with very believable landscapes of a nearly dead civilization as we know it (hence 4 stars). But the plot itself is fairly predictable, and so is the preformance of the lead actors. Bring the saviour of the humankind to those who can turn him/her (""the chosen one"") into a remedy. Yes, some likable characters would suddenly die, but this is not enough to make this series original. I managed to watch 4 episodes, but then had enough. No matter what's going to happen, I care neither for the story nor for the characters. Pushing the buttons of people's feelings (learned from Mr Spielberg, the great master of this kind of manipulation?), like in episode 3, should be a ""no-no"" in movie business. Same as exploiting the theme of a death of a child to squeeze some tears from the awed audience. Such a waste of time and money spent to produce this mediocre piece of pretentious trash."

Two things to take away from shows like these: If an apocalyptic event does happen and there are a few survivors, humans will turn on each other. E.g., toilet paper in covid times. Humans are idiots. When the planet is about to be taken over by mushrooms and zombies with no civilized convenience in sight, why do people insist on surviving? What's the next step? Make more humans and eventually live underground and drink distilled piss?

Anyway, just a reminder: athletes foot is fungal. Not too long now before the fungi slowly make every cell of the human body smell like old decomposing havianas."

It's nothing new, the drama, the dynamic of the characters, the world, the look..I've seen it all and it's boring when you've watched 6 seasons of twd.

First part of episode 1 was great, got a bit boring towards the end. Ep 2 was ok, got a tiny bit more world building, but I feel the show rushes world building because people have either seen the walking dead or played the game or both. Feels a bit lazy to rely on that. Episode 3 was great as a standalone short film, but didn't add much to the story, but still enjoyed it. But even this episode felt like out of the book of twd. Twd also had these kinds of ""anomalies"" episodes. And in episode four we just got another twd trope with the mean leader and her followers. I'm giving up after four episodes. To boring, nothing new, feels like I know how all the dramatic arcs are going to go."

That's because Ellie is strong, tough, and intelligent enough to defend herself. And Joel, has a painful past, having had his daughter Sarah killed. The changing as they know each other is very detailed by wonderful screenplay. Saw a lot of criticism , some of them said ""It's definitely overrated"" but I think the critic IS wrong. If you take this drama like this opinion , don't watch this amazing consequence.

He has always been a favorite of mine and that is the main reason I decided to watch this. Bella Ramsey on the other hand - I don't get the rave reviews. I'm not impressed with her acting one bit.

Permalink";"The pilot was excellent. Introduced us to the main character Joel, where he came from, how the end of the world came to pass (very original idea), the motivation behind why Joel does what he does in every episode after, and it sets a great tone. The post-apocalyptic sets are top-notch. The main societal problem (outside of the epidemic) is not a new idea but it works for the most part. Some of the acting is superb, mostly from the guest stars (Nick Offerman is the best in my opinion), Pedro Pascal is good when he can keep his Texas accent, Bella Ramsey has one mode and doesn't do it all that well. Also, I love post-apocalyptic shows and movies, probably my most favorite genre.

Buuuuuuuuuut, the show went downhill for me after that. It was a slow decline until the episodes 7 and 8, then it fell off a cliff. Seriously, what the heck was up with episode 7? Man that was bizarre. Ellie's character is obnoxious with near zero redeemable qualities. She is constantly outwitting adults who have her dead to rights with the stupidest of escapes (sometimes killing multiple grown men without a gun in one sitting) that any person with half a brain could have prevented. Joel heals miraculously from a near deadly wound in seemingly minutes and turns into a stealthy assassin. Joel started out with a rooting resume but it has diminished with each episode. I mean what happened to creating likable characters? Heroes can have flaws but they must have redeemable qualities and values. Joel has lost most of his. Its so easy to see the heroes escape route or deus ex machine about to save them from a perilous situation. Because of that the suspension of disbelief goes right out the window.

All in all it's a shame. A shame the source material got this treatment. It had a lot of promise but like a lot of shows in the last 5 years they peter out within the first season or by season 2. Westworld and Raised By Wolves are two examples on HBO alone."

Scary because the show truly shows what the world would probably look like if there was an apocalyptic event. I can't imagine the amount of work it took to pull off making this show so authentic. The creators picked a great location to film, Canada turned out to be perfect. Pedro Pascal absolutely NAILS the part. Bella Ramsev also nails the character.

I think there's been maybe three scenes with zombies in the entire series. Plus they ignore the entire plot line that she carries special blood, which is what was going to make this story interesting or novel and could have set up some really great storylines and conversations and characters, but that never happens. The fact she has special blood and immunity is never really discussed. And the goal of reaching someone who can do something with her special blood just seems to dissipate.. What a missed opportunity. And then multiple episodes focus on random characters or storylines that don't contribute to the overall story or characters and just seem to waste our time. The writing is nothing special and the characters are often stupid, making stupid decision after stupid decision, that it just takes me out of the show and I lose interest. So it just gets frustrating to watch because I don't know what the point is."

It's literally rated 15. The level of violence and gore and sustained threat from the virus is COMPLETELY missing from the tv show. It's been completely removed in favour of human melodrama.

It's been rushed through and we arrive at the final episode not caring if Ellie is 'the cure' because it's just humans that are the threat. The infected have gone on holiday here. It's fallen flat.

Get the remastered version of the game and strap yourself in for an absolute THRILL of a nightmare. That's where the beauty series comes from. If you aren't a gamer watch the connected cutscenes on YouTube to get the real drama."

I have a soft spot for zombie horror and post-apocalyptic stuff. But, most of the shows about zombie apocalypse trip on the exact same clichés with the focus quickly moving away from the zombies and to the survivors and their relationships & interactions. Many good shows have turned into soaps with the actual horror element barely involved.

Of course, The Last of Us also includes stories about people interactions and relationships, as it would be hard to relate to the characters if they'd be just these one-dimensional faces. However, maybe it is because of the adaptation from a video game, The Last of Us doesn't drag on these matters too much outside from the few main characters. And that is so refreshing!

I also wasn't a fan of casting Pedro Pascal as Joel, but I gotta admit he's doing great job. Bella Ramsey as Ellie is phenomenal.

The only reason I'm not giving this a 10/10 is because the show is yet unfinished."

They were cool, but they weren't a large part of the shows. It was mainly talking with a lot of violence between humans. Because of this I probably won't watch the second season. If they decide to make the zombies and the science behind them a larger part of show it would be worth paying to seen it. It did have some science in it, but they should have made with two stories. The first could have been about civilization, like the show was about. The second could has be more science driven."

My main gripe is this tendency in modern series to grind the action to a halt with stand alone flashback episodes. I know not every episode can move the story along and knowing a characters past can explain their actions now. However these episodes are usually overlong and they lack subtlety.

This is the case with episode 3 and 7 of this series. We get 1 hour long episodes that could easily have been condensed in 15 minutes. The audience is not dumb, writers need to stop thinking they are.

It was especially problematic in episode 7 because episode 6 was so good and then we were left hanging. These breaks in the story actually kill momentum and do not serve as cliffhangers like the writers think they do. A measure of proof is episodes 3 and 7 are the lowest rated here. They are fine episodes but momentum and story killers not enhancers.

That being said this is an outstanding series and the friendship between the two leads is very endearing and well played."

8 episodes in so far and we're almost at the end of the first game where some cool things were left out and certain aspects were changed like the introduction of Ellie, the displayed intensity of the Fireflies conflict with FEDRA occurring in the world, some more serious fight scenes, Bill being alive and setting up badass traps (where Joel is upside down trying to keep Ellie alive from infected) , and some other signature parts of each of the game's chapters.

Great show overall and fantastic cast but I just know it couldve been done a little better for the popularity and perfection of this franchise."

Permalink";"""The Last of Us"" had a lot of hype surrounding it, and while it had some redeeming qualities, the execution of the show left a lot to be desired. I would rate this show a 7/10.

One of the major issues with the show was the lack of cohesiveness. It seemed to have one storyline going on at a time, but the side stories used to back up the overall plot seemed too fragmented rather than coherent. Additionally, new characters suddenly appeared in each episode and then disappeared, making it difficult to connect with them.

The characters themselves were also a disappointment. They were flat and lacked any dynamic qualities that would make them interesting to watch. This made it difficult to care about their survival or the overall outcome of the show.

Furthermore, the dialogue was very weak and lacked any depth. As a viewer, I didn't feel any emotional connection to what the characters were saying. It was as if the dialogue was only there to move the plot forward rather than to add any substance to the show.

While the show had occasional moments of real danger from the zombies, there were times when I felt extra safe, and the apocalypse didn't seem to be going on at all. This lack of consistency made it difficult to feel invested in the show.

Overall, ""The Last of Us"" had potential but failed to live up to the hype. The lack of cohesiveness, weak dialogue, and flat characters made it difficult to connect with the show."

Permalink";"Episode 3 of The Last of Us is one of the best single episodes of any tv show in a long time: it has almost nothing to do with the central plot, and instead is a beautiful love story. And that's about all you can say that works in this rather dreary zombie (but they're not quite zombies, they're mushroom people!) series. The problem is that outside of that one hour everything else is simply by-the-book, and it's not a very good book. The Pedro Pascal character is a one note, grumpy unpleasant hero, while Bella Ramsey plays one of the most irritating characters ever to appear on the screen: spoiled, nasty, and annoying, and on top of that, this little creature is able to take out many grown men whenever the plot needs her to do so. And that's the real problem here; this is a plot driven show, the action comes out of the need to push the story forward, not out of the characters themselves.

All in all, this is simply another in a long line of end-of-civilization shows, and the only reason it is getting such good reviews here seems to be due to those who love the game it's based on. For the rest of us, outside of Episode 3, there's nothing to care about."

Pedro Pascal is just such a fun actor to follow and is enjoyable in everything he puts out these days. It's nice to have one of those kinds of actors again. He definitely is the strongest focus in the show and I'm not sure how good I feel this show would be without him. But since I don't have to I'm enjoying it for what it is which is interesting.

What I don't like about this show is the behavior of the little girl Pedro's character has sworn to protect. It's not the actress herself as she filled in fine in past HBO series and I know HBO likes to stick with who they know. To me it's how the director has or writers have her behaving and I hope they can get this filled in as the flashback episode did nothing to describe how a 14 year old girl in a post apocalyptic world could be anything other than timid and afraid or, alternately, a straight up hardass when she knows she's a target, if exposed, for execution, kidnapping or even worse. This bratty entitled behavior may fit in with the adolescent experience of a pre-apocalyptic society...but simply does not add up here especially considering the circumstances around her.

It's the only drain on the show for me thus far."

I wanna see great scenes from the game. I wanna see Joel and Ellie fighting with infecteds and things like that.

By the way, the producers only cared about padding up some episodes and dialogues instead of making something really cool to watch. For example, the third episode was horrible and unnecessary.

An what is the purpose of changing the characters? Was it really necessary? Because Sarah, Bill, Maria, Tommy, David and Sam aren't the same characters from the game.

The only good things about the show are Pedro and Bella.

But if you are only interested in the main storyline, I would recommend you to drop ep 3, 5 and 7 so far. This way, it looks quite impressive to me what HBO got out of a survival horror game. Sure, some cast may be a bit daring and it took me a while to get used to them but over time they grew into their roles or just died either. There is a dark world drawn on screen and this alone is probably not to everyone's taste. You should be ready to see different kinds of violence as well as what they call diversity nowadays."

Bella Ramsey is impossibly riveting as the show's teen protagonist. Their screen presence has a gravity that holds together the admittedly well-worn tropes of zombie and apocalypse with a tender human lens that deepens and transcends the genre.

I wasn't struck by Pedro Pascal's performance initially, but I'm coming to experience it as a slow burn. The dynamic between him and Bella is a uniquely intense and compelling energy.

I also think that Joel and Ellie's connection as an intergenerational pairing that doesn't exactly fit parent/child specifications adds a breadth to what it means to chose your people and fight for them, even when it's scary."

This show is based on a video game, but it is by far the best of its kind. The story (about how fungi took over the human mind) while kind of out there, is the true definition of good sci-fi.

The storytelling is very edge-of-your-seat. I am not aware of the video game but it is clear that the story line have been thought out very very well, and will stand the test of time without any plot holes.

Acting and atmosphere and production are very good as well. Its been a long while since I actually look forward to watching something.

To start, the show looked great at the start, with the story taking us through the ruins of cities. And the travel through the country is also well shot.

The actors are fine, with most of the actors performing well with what they are given.

The monsters are an interesting turn on zombies, though they seem very rarely seen.

But I am finding the stories increasingly dull and repetitive. Perhaps it is the limited look at the monsters. Perhaps it is the slowness of the story. Perhaps it is the apparent filler episodes.

We hear about FEDRA and other organization but we really do not feel them.

There is potential here. Here's hoping it finds it."

The pace is extremely slow, it lacks tension and sense of urgency - mainly because of these intermediate episodes that focuses on certain characters without pushing the story anywhere.

Permalink";"For some it's the best game adaptation ever. For others is slow and boring. Well, the truth is somewhere in-between.

For those who think it is slow and boring, I disagree. It follows the plot in the game fairly accurately and keeps to the main character development points. I think it is well acted, and actually think Bella Ramsey gets the mannerisms of Ellie right. The atmosphere of the show is pretty bang on too.

However, it this is not enough to embrace the full impact of the game. Aside from a few flash moments in a couple of episodes, there is just not enough action. You rarely feel a sense of horror and panic. The game was about overcoming the infected and the story parts linked it together (or was it the other way around?) Either way, the show doesn't get this right. If it had, then the horror/action scenes would raise the excitement levels and help engage the audience more. It would also help you connect with the characters more and understand how desperate they all were. I appreciate their desire not to becoming just another zombie show, but too almost ignore it completely? Yep, not a great choice.

Therefore, it does not deserve the 9.1 rating it has and over time this will come down dramatically. I hope that they learn from this and series 2 takes a more rounded approach. It should have been a 12 episode series, to allow this to develop fully. Knowing the extensive content covered in The Last of Us II; I think this will need to be split into 2 seasons of about 8 - 10 episodes each.

I imagine this show is better for those who have played the games first. But still, this is probably a 7.5 show for me. With the extra action, it could be a 9."

Permalink";"As someone who played the game, I was excited to see the Last of Us (HBO) show come to life. Overall, the show did not disappoint, with excellent performances from Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey as Joel and Ellie. The actors brought the characters to life in a way that was both faithful to the game and unique to the show.

The camera work in the show was also impressive, capturing the beauty and brutality of the post-apocalyptic world. The use of lighting and color was especially effective in creating a moody and immersive atmosphere. The show did a great job of showcasing the various locations and environments that Joel and Ellie traverse, making each location feel distinct and memorable.

The pacing of the show was mostly good, with enough action and character development to keep the story moving forward. However, there were some filler episodes that dragged on and detracted from the overall experience. These episodes felt like they were included just to pad out the runtime, and they broke the immersion and momentum of the story.

Despite this flaw, the show did a great job of capturing the emotional core of the game. The themes of loss, love, and survival were explored in a way that felt authentic and powerful. The Last of Us (HBO) is a great adaptation of the game, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the original story."

Permalink";"Despite the impressive production value and high-quality performances from its cast, the show's lackluster writing and pacing fall short of expectations.

The character development is good but the dialogue is often clichéd and predictable. The main characters are not particularly likable. Some of the side characters are much more interesting (for example, episode 3).

The show's pacing is also a major issue, as it struggles to maintain momentum and suspense. This works sometimes to provide a break but the breaks are sometimes jarring. They can suddenly end and we're back in action as if the break didn't happen. The show would work better with more transition between the character and plot development.

Episode 4 really started going off the rails and the episodes were uneven after that.

The show's reliance on graphic violence and gore also feels gratuitous and excessive, lacking any real purpose or impact.

Overall, ""The Last of Us"" fails to provide a compelling and engaging narrative."

When I heard they were making a show I thought it would turn out like most video game movies, at best case it would be watchable, fun, and forgettable. I was very wrong, they kept everything that was good about the game, in all fairness the game was pretty well written, but they have added layer on top of layer of plot and incredibly interesting characters. Combine that with some very scary zombies, good tension and it's a winner. This is far more than your average zombie outing. My wife hates just about anything related to horror(except the conjuring series for some reason), but she will watch this, and deep down in a place she won't admit probably likes it."

Unfortunately, after a great start, I've already lost interest by episode 3.

People are praising the acting but I'm not convinced.

Anna Torv is good, but Pedro Pascal's main job is to grumble and scowl. Sure it fits the role but it's not exactly ground-breaking.

The teenager is annoying as hell, which I guess is pretty realistic but not very enjoyable.

Adapting game plots to TV is hard. Even if the initial premise is good, games are a lot more engaging simply because they require audience participation.

TV versions of the story need to spruce things up significantly and success isn't guaranteed.

This one falls flat on its face pretty quickly.

It's not terrible and might be worth the watch if you are really into the genre, but it ain't a 9/10 either!"

Who knew that dancing in Halloween masks could be so fun. This differently is my new favorite HBO show next to ""Doom Patrol""!!!! When the show first started, I was overly critical of the casting. The actor playing Joel was pretty much spot on. I cannot say the same for Tommy. Everytime I see this actor in a scene; it throws off the believability of the show for me. The same with Joel's daughter. With that being said, every actor involved in this project does an amazing job. And I always love how HBO recycle actors from previous HBO. Did anyone else notice Tara from ""True Blood""? Awesome!!!!!!"

Permalink";"The score is way too high. I think it got overhyped by some of the game fans but it's nowhere near of what the game delivered. It's not bad at all and there's some very good scenes, some of them improved from the game but most of them was not enough.

The whole story feels rushed and you get all the details on a plate. Some elements of the story needs to build up slowly.

Also not enough action scenes (I almost forgot that there's an apocalypse happening) and some of the dramatic scenes feels empty like they're trying to imitate the game too much but not in a natural way.

All of the above leads to a poor bonding with the characters almost to the point I don't really care about them.

The casting of Joel and Ellie in my opinion wasn't great. Pedro and Bella are good actors but they just didn't suit the characters for me. Some of their scenes feel over acted, I felt hard to believe them.

If you're not falling in love with these characters and don't identify with them then you miss the whole point of this story.

Some good words deserved for the production on the sets design and building the world of the apocalypse beautifully (Despite the lack of infected show)

Overall the show is good but the potential of this story is way way higher Than what it delivered. I really wanted to love it but it was lacking emotions and action.

Maybe video games shouldn't become TV shows after all."

Permalink";"I've finished the game 4 times, just because the story in it is so good, and the character build up is fantastic.

What the game does is settle you in its world. From overgrown cities, through its midwestern setting, it grounds you, enhancing nostalgia for the pre-pandemic world and the bleakness of its current one with Santaolalla's score strumming your emotional chords.

The series tries its best to stay faithful to the story of the game, but it's clear that the budget isn't there to guarantee that feat. Many episodes are devoid of infected, while they are a main fixture in the game. For instance in the last episode I've just seen that introduced David, the game has Ellie and David fight off infected while they wait for his buddy to come back with the medicine. It creates a little bonding experience between the two, that enforces the wolf in sheep's clothing David is. (Good to see Troy Baker in the series though!)

It's however not just the absence of the infected that brings the series down somewhat, but mainly its pacing. The game's story is told in seasonal chapters (summer, fall, winter, spring), and you spend 3 to 6 hours in every chapter, giving the story time to elaborate on the events and its characters. Combatting infected in the game, which you do a lot, also enhances your understanding of what they are, how they react and how to effectively combat them.

The series seems to sprint through the events, because it needs to tell the whole story in a single 10 episode season.

It suffers from having not enough episodes. The David episode should've at least spanned two, but then also included the infected ambush, and the chase through the diner at the end should've been longer and could've used a little better directing, because in the game it's a truly intense sequence. You know those intense scenes from horror movies where the monster is chasing the main character...well, this one should've been more like that.

There's still a lot that needs to happen before the end, but there's only one episode left, which again seems to mean it will rush through the story.

I understand that sooner or later the overwhelming success of this game would end up in a cinematic adaptation, and a series was the right choice. However, the budget is not there to do the game the justice it deserves, not in length nor production value.

Watch the series to wet your beak, but know that it is but a diminished version of the true masterpiece that remains the game."

Also what is with the gay agenda, already there are 2 episodes with gay characters...this is exaggerated. Also the show is too diluted, nothing much happens. For eg in the last episode that I watched, they go to a mall and goof around for most of the episode (1 hr)--I was waiting for an Infected to come and finish this stupidity already... Also many ideas that could be promising are not explored. For eg they go to a deserted univ campus and out of nowhere appear 3 guys that just happen to be there?!... Just a waste of time, the action and ideas so far could have been better presented in only 3 episodes."

In the case of regular shows, many should not go beyond four seasons. If they do, as a rule, they become boring and ridiculous. In the case of 'The Last of Us', the first few episodes were gripping, well acted and written (Episode 3 especially). However, it started going downhill after the 5th. The 6th episode should have been it's last. Episode 7 was was especially bad and broke the rhythm of the series. Episode 8 was overly violent (to animals as well) and extremely far-fetched. Producers should heed the 'less is more' rule. If a miniseries can't be wrapped up in a maximum of 7 episodes, it's likely to lose its mojo. If a regular tv show goes beyond 5 seasons, it will probably end up in the ratings basement. Less is more."

Somehow this show defies the trend and manages to be engaging and draw you into it's world - a world we've mostly seen before - but not with these characters - and by that I guess I really mean, not with these leads. Pedro Pascal and his young co-star Bella Ramsey do the lion's share of the heavy lifting here - and they do it with understated brilliance - between them they manage to stand for our last chance - and they make you care in the process. Not so much because it's our last chance, but more because of what they've gradually come to represent.

It also has to be said that the production design and execution is top notch - convincingly bleak, abandoned, and showing signs of being well fought over and devastated.

All in all The Last Of Us is a very satisfying watch. It's an easy 8, probably a 9 - so 8 1/2."

The show follows the journey of Joel and Ellie as they navigate a post-apocalyptic world ravaged by a deadly fungus that has turned most of humanity into infected monsters. The chemistry between the two lead actors, Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey, is simply astounding, and they bring their characters to life in a way that is both authentic and moving.

Visually, the show is stunning, with breathtaking landscapes and stunningly realistic CGI that will transport you to the world of The Last of Us. The attention to detail is impeccable, and you can tell that the creators of the show have poured their hearts and souls into every frame.

The storyline is where the show truly shines, however. The writing is top-notch, with a perfect balance of action, drama, and heart-wrenching emotion that will have you reaching for the tissues more than once. The show explores themes of love, loss, and redemption in a way that is both thought-provoking and deeply moving.

Overall, The Last of Us TV show is nothing short of a masterpiece. It is a must-watch for fans of the video game, but even if you have never played it before, the show stands on its own as a triumph of storytelling and filmmaking. Do not miss out on this incredible piece of television history."

If it was a good show wouldn't be able to wait for the last episode but honestly if they said it was gonna release a year from now I wouldn't mind."

Way too similar to Walking Dead and World War Z. Some of the scenes and camera angles look like they're copied from either show. On the plus side Pedro Pascal is awesome. He deserves all the accolades. On the other hand, I'm sure that Bella Ramsey has done some great stuff but watching her on Last of Us is painful akin to fingernails going down a chalkboard. HBO should stick to what it does best, original programming and stop these costs cutting measures."

This show is a showcase to what a good marketing budget can accomplish. The name recognition of the award winning video game, coupled with HBOs deep pockets for marketing, helped propel this into a completely overblown B-list show. The marketing was so good that people might actually believe it is something extraordinary.

It's not. It's a good show to throw on if you've ran out of content. It's better than your average Netflix show. It's not anything special."

The acting is solid, the story is okay. But I cant see were the 9.1 rating is coming from.

The first episode was good, the second episode meandered away from the main story to show us a love story, which basically didn't progress the story. Now episode four does the same thing, gives us a flashback, another love story that doesn't move things on.

Is this an attempt to flesh things out? To me it didn't add to the story. First we have two gay men, now to gay women. While I im not of the fan of the expression ""woke"", I could see how people could make that accusation.

Zack Synder beautifully depicts a sense or panic and despair in Dawn Of The Dead, especially in it's opening scenes. I hoped The Last Of Us would hit the same note, but it hasn't matched it.

To quote Elivs, ""a little more action"" would help this series. Please don't let it turn into what The Walking Dead became after season 1."

If you've played the games you will love this. Even if you haven't I highly recommend watching it, you will love it.

Both Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey are perfectly cast as Joel and Ellie. The supporting cast is equally cast.

The pilot episode is the best I've ever seen, it had me hook from the very beginning.

The Last of Us should serve as future reference to how video game adaptations should be made."

Permalink";"People love the video game and I get that there must be a nostalgic delight in seeing favourite game characters on the big screen done with a modicum of quality.

For the rest of us, this is a competent if mediocre rehash of all of the post-apocalyptic zombie tales and tropes we have seen before in seemingly endless seasons of The Walking Dead and countless other shows and films of the genre. It's a journey through the ruins of civilization beset with zombies and the even greater threat of predatory human beings. Granted, there is the occasional flourish like the honestly touching Episode 3, but in general expect no surprises and you won't be disappointed.

If you want a fresh and novel take on the fall of civilization, seek out Station Eleven.

There's nothing I find more annoying than the sarcastic child character and the teenager Ellie is that taken to 11. It's a shame that this could have been an interesting character - a girl who has grown up entirely after fall of civilization, raised (presumably in seclusion) by the totalitarian government. A totally alien perspective, like a peasant from North Korea suddenly extracted and thrown on the streets of Manhattan. You get none of that from either the writing or Bella Ramsey's portrayal. Ellie acts and talks like a teenager from the present day - worse, like a 40-year old's vision of a teenager, as seen in anachronisms like Ellie casually picking up a cassette tape and popping it in the car stereo - as if she'd know what that was or how to make it work."

Permalink";"Where do I begin? I was a big fan of the first game. Joel and Ellie invoked emotion in me I didn't know was possible to feel from a video game. After an amazingly perfect pilot episode, I thought this was going to be a series to rival Walking Dead or GOT.

Unfortunately, after episode two, things bog down in a hurry. The infected, the real danger in the show disappear and it devolves into a drama show. At least The Walking Dead had the good sense to spend a couple of seasons where the dead were the danger before it became a human drama story with largely hit or miss episodes.

The third episode in particular was insulting to say the least. Just when I'm fully invested in Joel and Ellie I get an entire episode of Bill and Frank who were glossed over in the game. Their relationship was merely implied and if not for a brilliant and emotional turn from Nick Offerman I might have stopped watching the series outright. There are ways to incorporate character development without actual filler episodes in a season one that only has seven episodes.

The biggest problem I have with the series, however, and the reason it couldn't manage even a 5 for me was the cast. Ellie's character is badly miscast. Bella Ramsay's Ellie is vulgar, snarkey, abrasive and totally unlikable. It's a chore to watch her scenes without shaking my head. The leader of the group in KC was an utter failure in casting. Does anyone think that anybody would follow that woman anywhere? I thought Tess was OK and true to the source material and as much as I dont like Pedro Pascal, he's not only a terrific Joel, he carried season one on his back. The misfire on Ellie is series killing for me though. How you could make the most important character in the franchise the least likable character in the series is unforgivable."

We get more backstory and information in the following episodes but we lose the sense of urgency we felt at the start but we do receive flashbacks with character context. These episodes are informative but lack the tension and action of previous episodes."

I was certainly excited to see Nico in the beginning and agree with another person that Bella and Nico's characters should have been swapped. I also think that Pedro and Nick would have been better off with their respective roles reversed.

I haven't played the game, and now not sure if I even want to.

The Highlight of the story to me is how they explained how the zombies came to be... its not really all that far fetched when you think about it."

I honestly didn't think a show was necessary because the game already felt like an interactive movie, but after watching the show I thoroughly.enjoy the real life adaptation. I like that it follows the game.closely while taking some deviations. I've read a few people's reviews about the filler episodes 3 and 7 and completely understand why some feel that way, but again having played the games those episodes aren't just fillers as they fill in important backstories to know these characters even more. So I applaud the show for investing time into who the characters while perhaps sacrificing some action. That being the other criticism I've seen....where are the zombies!! I'd be lying if I didn't want to feel the intensity of more clickers roaming around, but on the other hand, each scene with the fungal.zombies feels that much more interesting.

For.those looking for a slower pace drama that takes time to develop the characters for what i will expect will be a huge payback if the show continues to follow the game, then you will likely enjoy The Last oF Us. It's not a perfect show, but despite the faults it has, it's still a very well done and interesting show that stays true to its source material."

Starting with ""A long long time"", it detours to unrelated ( but yes, touching and important subjects) issues. At some point (episodes6-7?) I had to refer to IMDB to understand what was going on, as the time line was absolutely confusing.

It tries so hard, but so many good movies have been made (I Am Legend, A Quiet Place, to start) that it just seems to be trying to put together the best of each - without success. It makes a point of addressing social issues- and it does it well. But so far... meh."

I wanted to love this show.. the episodes just seem to drag out.

Nothing seems to happen and always end on an underwhelming note. The episode will finish and I can barely recall what happened in the hour.

The only good acting is from Pedro Pascal (the man couldn't act badly even if he tried)

The characters bought on are weak, they have the tough guy act on Bella Ramsey swearing more than a pirate and too much PC.. to the point it's so odd and unbelievable so it doesn't gel.

Hopefully season 2 picks up."

I've never played the game so its all new to me. There are not many action scenes, it makes Fear the Walking Dead seem like constant mayhem. Here you're lucky if one mushroom guy gets put down in an entire episode.

After the episode about Ellie's lesbian relationship, and considering episode 3, the show seems strangely fixated on gay relationships.

I'm sure fans of the game are super happy to see it come live on TV. I guess lots depends on if your happy with the relatively slow pace of the show."

But I get sadly zero connection to Ellie. She's definitely not my Ellie. Sadly just 50% feeling at all. Even if I know it will not happen, i would be happy to have another actor in Season Two."

Permalink";"What can I say? This show is everything I'd hoped for when I learned it would happen. I remember playing the game for the first time when I was around 12, so almost Ellie's age. I remember relating so much to her character, to her desperation to be helpful and to do something, to the guilt she felt of being a survivor in a cruel and merciless world, I especially remember feeling the warmth and the safety when Joel embraced her, when he fought for her, when he did everything foe her, time and time again. I remember crying and laughing and struggling with those damn bricks and killing the clickers, and I remember finishing the game and being absolutely distraught, but so so content. After that first time playing it, I played it many more times, enough to know exactly what each little thing in the show is referencing. I notice the little details, the writings on the walls, the way some places look just like in the game, and the absurdity (in a good way) of the casting. Bella IS Ellie Williams. They portray Ellie and not only is it accurate to the original game, but they actually add to the character to give it more depth and they succeed. I've seen Ellie more thanks to the show and I've understood and noticed things I never would've seen if it weren't for Bella's portrayal. I believe it's pointless speaking about Pedro Pascal's Joel. Just like Bella's case, he is Joel, and he makes Joel, and he ADDS to Joel. The chemistry they have with each other is perfect and they're perfect in their roles.

The show in particular manages to take the game's main points and explore them even more, so all the little looks and expressions, it's no longer just pixel on a screen, but it's real human beings portraying humans in a world that's on fire. Not even on fire, but a world that is burned and forever touched by a fire long extinguished.

Each episode is accurate to the original plot and in the parts that differ, they still manage to make it look like it isn't! And as a big fan of the original games (seriously, I played the first one at least 10 times, the DLC even more, the second one at least 4 times) I can say it's absolutely perfect.

TLDR; the show is great, keeping the atmosphere from the original bases and adding up to it, while never actually straying from the game. The actors's talent to not only encapsulate the characters, but to add MORE to them is sensational and every scene is amazing. Bella and Pascal do a great job as Ellie and Joel and they could not have casted better people."

Permalink";"One of the best series of this year so far. I haven't played the game so my review isn't based on a preconcieved concept of the story rather just a viewer who is entirely new to the story.

The opening episode is intense but well paced, they establish the pre-apocalyptic world in a few opening scenes and then present the world post-apoclapyse, in a sequence which doesn't drag on but doesn't seem rushed.

The beauty of the series lies in the way it establishes a multidimensional post-apocalyptic world where our protoagnists are not only at threath from the ""infected"" but also various other characters.

The series attempts to attack the basic presumption of this post-apoclapyse/Zombie genre productions where it is a story of survival which conveniently pitches the survivors of the new world against the infected. This series goes beyond that concept and succeeds in establishing a complex yet interesting post-apoclapyse world where the basic nature of humans is put on display in a world where all society and rules have crumbled yet civilization has survived and now adapted. This approach leaves room for such interesting storytelling where post-apocalypse we see dictatorships and democracies emerge while also representing those who do not conform to the new world order and that too from the view ofvarious lenses. A concept like this is common in fiction books but very rarely has it been done right on tv and this one just nails it.

Furthermore, another aspect of the series which left me in awe is the brilliant world-building with various well shot locations and deeply written characters. The show takes it's time to establish certain characters and even locations for that matter, to give the viewer, a proper feel and context for what the world is like. Some viewers may feel this does little to add to the progression of the show, but for me it makes it even more immersive as a viewing experience."

Each episode starts, you get maybe 5 minutes of actual plot, then a flashback that will not end. Also, in the last episode, they show you the zombie that will attack, and you're just waiting for it to attack the entire episode. It's not that hard to be real suspense.

This also takes place over 20 a 25 years and the men aren't growing beards or really aging. Also, other than a magazine being thrown; no mention of going to the bathroom. Thought Archie Bunker made that clear in 1970.

As I said, I just don't get it. Already invested 7 hours, so I'll watch the full 10 episodes. Perhaps a waste of time but maybe some space aliens will show up. Just don't get it!"

The issue, though, is that the same trend persists as we get more episodes, and now nearing the end of the first season, I have to say that close to half the show has been totally pointless, to the point that the good is beginning to have a hard time making up for it. We literally get entire episodes (and yeah - plural) of filler, flash backs of character history that consists of pointless interactions and dialogues between them which actually seemingly add nothing to the show or it's character development. What's also interesting is that in contrast to the beginning of the season, the show now is taking place in far more boring (now almost always indoor) locations.

I hope they turn it around some, because at this rate they'll fall below the quality of the later TWD episodes, already in their first season."

Permalink";"Quite a good start of the adaptation of one of the best games, but as the show progresses it becomes more and more slow and lukewarm, those flashbacks lasting whole episode kill the mood. Seventh episode was dragging so much that I fast forwarded big part of it. Is it really the pick of what the west TV entertainment (look at the rates!) has to offer? So I decided to cancel HBO subscription (there is rarely anything interesting to watch) and turn my eyes to the east. For example Korean shows are so much more unpretentious, teeming with ideas, sometimes wild, sometimes cliche, but very gripping. Stranger, Replay 1988, Law School, etc. And there are a lot of Indian and Japanese products in queue. Greetings from Poland."

Permalink";"If you're looking for a thrilling and emotional adaptation of the acclaimed video game The Last of Us, you might want to look elsewhere. The web series The Last of Us is a disappointing and dull attempt to cash in on the popularity of the game, but it fails to capture its essence and charm. The series follows Joel and Ellie, two survivors of a zombie apocalypse, as they travel across a ravaged America in search of a cure. However, the series lacks the tension, action, and character development that made the game so engaging. The actors are wooden and unconvincing, the dialogue is cheesy and clichéd, and the plot is full of holes and inconsistencies. The zombies are barely seen or heard, and when they do appear, they look like cheap Halloween costumes. The series is so boring that you might find yourself rooting for the zombies to end it all. The Last of Us is not worth your time or money. It's the last thing you want to watch."

With every episode, they've been getting better and better as Ellie and Joel and setting up brilliantly for season 2.

Each episode has been improved in ways the game just couldn't do it. Only TV/Movies can do things that games miss out on and I'm glad they preserved the look and feel of the environment from the game.

I don't think there has ever been a better video game to TV adaptation (is there?)

Pedro too has so far nailed his performance as Joel.

While the other supporting characters are great, they are short lived and don't last

Permalink";"It's clear that this series' rating has been artificially inflated by bots or fake ratings. While I was initially excited by the casting of Ellie, I've been let down because Bella is emotionless and hasn't captured Ellie's character in a way that makes her convincing. Ellie tried to play tough in the game, and in a lot of ways, she was. This was mostly to Joel's dismay, but it is revealed through the story how much Ellie needed him because he was the real survivor, and she was still learning. She tried to rebel against him in the beginning, but as they navigated the post apocalyptic world, she began to respect and learn from him, and each other's presence filled a void in each of them-a daughter for Joel and a parent for Ellie.

Joel, in the beginning didn't want to have to transport her. This seemed to be captured in some ways in the series, but he was cold, walled off and angry in the game. Now he's a pushover, and seems to crumble and falter at the slightest amount of pressure from Ellie in the series. This is taking away from the impact of twenty years of suffering from Joel's perspective. Aside from that the pacing is dreadfully slow, and the ""adaptations"" that everyone in the higher reviews keep wailing about are not delivering what they should be.

Overall, Pascal was a good choice for Joel, but any purist knows that a younger Josh Brolin is basically Joel. If you want to visit Joel again, watch No Country for Old Men. A younger Mackenzie Foy would have been Ellie spot on, but this is all a fantasy.

For those of you who say go play the game if you are mad about the series, look at the reviews for the first game. The score has dropped since the release of the remastered cash grab versions, but they were much higher and are still relatively high and realistic. It's clear, based on part two and this series, that Naughty Dog only knows how to write agenda based, polarizing material now, and as I stated in the title, the helpful ratings, translated to the actual rating, would put this at a mid to high 6, which is where the rating of this series should be. The series is failing to capture the magic that of part one."

Everything about this show is excellent from the costumes, the editing, the camera work, and of course the acting and writing.

To truly appreciate the show, you have to play the games, not watch someone play them. The interactivity adds another layer of immersion which is bordering on traumatic. Both games for me were like Schindlers List as in they were all masterpieces but the experience was too difficult to repeat.

This live action adaptation perfectly captures what made the games great and I believe it has much to do with involving the incredible team that made the game. My hope is that this show will convince more people that games like the Last of Us and other games are art and among the greatest stories ever told."

It feel like with all these filler episodes that have nothing to do with the plot, the writers actually don't know what to do with this show. It doesn't feel like theirs a lot of direction. So far their travels to their destination is completely meaningless. It's boring travel with obstacles put in place just because, rather than meaningful obstacles that drive the plot."

I like the fact that its more about the psychology after a worldwide impact event and the interactions between people than it is about killing zombies.

The best improvement the show could make is to let the actors be more careful walking around in dark and empty alleys and making lots of noise to give the viewer the impression zombies are very dangerous and can kill you in an instant."

The series is set in a variety of environments, from abandoned cities to rural areas, and features a range of interesting and complex characters. In particular, the relationship between Joel and Ellie is the heart of the story, as they navigate the dangers of the infected world together and develop a close bond over the course of their journey.

The series does an excellent job of capturing the bleak, gritty atmosphere of the video game and translating it to the screen. The production design is top-notch, with a particular attention to detail in the various environments and the portrayal of the infected creatures. The use of practical effects and makeup is impressive, lending a visceral and realistic quality to the violence and gore in the series."

In addition, Bella adds no acting or emotion to the film, Kermit the Frog or anyone else could play like that. In my opinion, this is a desecration of the video game. The only positive thing is the elaboration of the infected, although it is good to see a specimen of them every episode. So no matter how good the make-up and the set design, if you have zero acting and a dirty director, the script looks like it was written by a two-year-old."

The Last of Us will be left as one of the really big classic series that will continue to fascinate and attract new viewers for many years to come. I am not one of those who have played the game the series is built on, so I should not comment on that. But this series has ""everything"": incredibly exciting, credible characters played by incredibly good actors with Pedro Pascal as the powerful protagonist. In addition, the series creators have been able to braid in side stories, backlash along the way that make us understand even better why the lead actors do as they do. Everything is intended and put together in a quirky and masterful way.

And I was forgetting; The content is also unpredictable. We are surprised and shocked along the way. Just wait for the next episode as one of the week's highlights. Hope they manage to keep the quality so high further."

The cinematography, Direction, costumes, and set design are movie quality. Each episode is connected, but there is a bit of anthology quality, as each one is a story within the story.

Personally I can't get a young much less talented Haley Joel Osment vibe from her in looks as well.

This show has delivered on all the big moments from the game that I wanted, and added even more context and content that was not available in the game due to budget constrictions OR for the fact that you only played through Joel's point of view (or briefly Ellie OR even more briefly Sarah).

The performances are outstanding, the direction has been solid, pacing has so far been perfect (only 2 eps left while writing this), and it has enhanced the game.

With that in mind Must start by saying the very first episode was grand, frenetic, dramatic, full packed with action... VERY promising! And I'm not saying that what came after is bad, because it isn't, but it lacks. Above all it lacks the sense of continuity, failing to delver the time scale and ""mileage"" the character faced and travelled through. It becomes very ""episodic"", with no sense of progress, an anthology of small stories within a bigger story arc, built to cater to a cause or another.

Technically it's very well executed, and the actors deliver very professionally. Nothing to fault (quite the contrary). It´s the pace and the Episodic nature that really struck a nerve with me. The last episode, for instance, was seen in under 5 minutes... Her background story could have been brilliantly displayed there, but at this point I just couldn't entertain the idea of spending 45+ minutes of flashback just to reach the conclusion of the episode where it mattered."

In most episodes, nothing of consequence ever seems to happen and the show offers a genuinely stale and sometimes painfully-boring experience for the viewers. As a result I've seen so many fans of the series endlessly scavenging for deeper meaning to the shows extremely shallow plot to justify the lack of engaging story, mystery, or general purpose we see episode after episode, where there really is none.

It's also unfortunately that one of the best episodes yet was completely centered around two individuals who are not main characters or even part of the larger plot that are not seen again and have more or less an inconsequential impact on the main characters. That's... not good, for obvious reasons. The largely standalone side-show episode featuring exclusively side-characters should never be the most engaging, emotional, and gripping one, but that's the reality of The Last of Us.

It's getting harder and harder for me to maintain the motivation to subject myself to this visual-Valium week after week, but I just keep hoping eventually it will improve. Lately, I'm not getting my hopes up. The writers seem fine to continue throwing weekly episodes containing very little plot development, next to no character development, and most importantly of all, no infected, down the pipeline.

If the game was already absolutely fantastic, the adaptation for TV is even better.

With HBO's production power, Druckman and Mazin could have resorted to every single cliché on the book, cheap action takes, jump scares and CGI monsters. They would still have a huge success. Instead, they courageously took the risk of a less traveled path, and we find drama and profound human experiences in the most unexpected of places.

Bella, Pedro and the entirety of this fabulous cast give performances like we rarely see on TV and the series most likely will grab every award for this season.

It is a world destroyed by a plague and overtaken by barbarism and totalitarian rule, but rest assured, this is about who WE are as humans and not about some walking dead plague. It's the Last of US. Emphasis in ""US""."

It's one thing to take your time to build up your characters, and it's a whole other thing to waste 2 and a half episodes of your already short 9 episode run on storylines that go nowhere. Yes I'm looking at you, episodes 3 and 7.

This show started stellar, but then went way down in episode 3 with an extra long episode that basically has very limited connection to the main plot thread - the characters in this ep are mentioned once in ep 4, and then never again. And then in ep 7, we go on the long flashback run that barely adds anything to the main storyline.

What exactly is the point of these detours? They don't actually add that much to the world building (that we didn't already know) nor to the characters and their relationships.

This is only my point of view of course, and I'm sure many of you may disagree. But as far as I'm concerned, I'm just about done with this show. It had so much potential, it sucks to see it wasted.

PS: I didn't play the games, so I have no clue how they tie up to the show.

Edit: subtracted 1 star after I saw the finale. Please give me my time back."

The first episode comes out very strong and delivers a unique story in a post-apocalyptic world. I was instantly excited for the coming new episodes. However, each one became more and more boring. The story in each episode is hard to be distinguished from one another. I guess it's not a problem to people who have played the game before since they have many memories to relate to. But to non-players, it's not the case. Eventually this series became kinda plain to me and is not worth the wait."

Don't get me wrong there are some moments/scenes in each episode that is good but it doesn't keep you riveting, it just send you to sleep. The backdrop scenes/landscape are amazing but thats it.

Ellie I'm not convinced, I can just bare to watch her antics and Katherine the leader, definitely I wasn't convinced of her role as the leader of the resistance of her softly voice.

Its a shame as the first episode and second looks so promising it fail to materialise. Walking dead is far superior to this."

The acting is top notch, the story is brilliant, and of course the visuals are breathtaking.

They'd be insane not to have at least two more seasons, though I'd like to have them plan a satisfying ending rather than just let it fall apart like GoT or Lost.

This should be the new standard for how to convert a video game to the screen. They stick to the game enough to satisfy the fans, and they expand when necessary to add much needed depth to the characters. Best of all, they manage to bring some humanity and hope back to the apocalypse genre.

Like any Zombie/Infected universe content it starts of good with build-up and character development. The first couple of episodes will keep you entertained but then it will start to run dry as they fail to keep the adventures interesting.

The shining point of the series is the production grade presentation of the infected which are outstanding and better than any other zombie movie. However they are not using their presence efficiently enough as if they don't want to play their triumph card too early. This decision leads to the series becoming a stale drama and the interaction between characters met on the way is lacking in depth or variety.

Atleast in series like TWD at the first half of the season there were several characters with interesting development and you could easily pick characters that you relate to.

Here the characters are just bland and the two main ones aren't special enough to keep you entertained along with the generic bandit villains that we have seen countless of times already.

In short: The show had great promise but deteriorated the longer it revealed it's slow unadventurous state."

The small changes being made are not impacting the story and character development at all. Bella Ramsey is all Ellie! She knows how to bring out the essence of Ellie in an incredible way. Pedro Paschal is perfect as Joel too!

I can't wait for season two to explore the events of the second game.

It has became an event here in my home, with my mother and brother, to watch together on Sunday's.

My ""negative"" point is that, in some episodes, could have more action, such as in the left behind one, with more infected maybe.

Good acting, but bad scripts. Whiny girl and predictable guy. Few characters that I feel sympathetic toward.

Important parts seem rushed, and boring parts are drawn out way too much. Even the scenery has lost its magic.

Another thing I was disturbed with was the obvious direction episode 7 ""left behind"" was taking since I know HBO has no... how should I put this?... No boundaries. I think with this bland and slow pace story the show will not survive for another season. But hey! This is HBO they have the money to keep a dead fish in a tank.

And that's what's clearly happening with this show, as some of the most pivotal scenes have been handled badly and the acting of the main protagonists in those scenes often pale in comparison to what we've seen in the videogame. Unfortunately more and more I'm starting to believe that 'The Last of us' didn't need a TV adaptation, as the videogame gave us everything we could possibly want and some... Would have made more sense to expand its world by creating a whole new story, with new characters, instead of giving us an inferior remake of a videogame which you could hardly do justice, let alone improve upon."

Permalink";"So I finally buckled and watched ""The Last of Us"". It's a pretty good show, sometimes even great, yet it's just not the ""Must watch"" people make it out to be.

I think the positives of the show are pretty well known by now and theres little to argue here. The main acctors have good chemistry, set pieces are great and it's beautifully shot. Since everybody is already raving about the positives I won't go into too much detail here and focus on the issues I had with the show.

One thing that was bugging me was the pacing and writing. Way too much is communicated via flashback or quasi stand-alone episodes. Thats really making the whole thing feel rather disjointed and caused huge problems in the end. It definitely felt like the show was running out of time and a lot of important plot points didn't get the attention they deserved. The actual finale of the show as well as the ending or epilogue felt extremely rushed and therefore hollow. No clue why they paced the show like this. My best bet is that they were trying to cram some extra fan service in.

But the biggest issue is that the show keeps repeating the same pattern of getting ones hopes up and ruining everything with a gut-punch twist. That might be effective if you do it once or twice but it gets old quickly. I stopped caring after a few episodes because I always felt like I was just watching the prelude to yet another catastrophe. Weirdly everything else is by the numbers and the show never really managed to surprise me. Raiders, cannibals, monsters - we've seen it all before and the show isnt really doing anything new with those tropes.

So despite the amazing chemistry between the two main actors and great production value I felt like watching just another zombie horror show after a while. If those arent right up your alley you can calmly skip ""The Last of Us""."

They removed some features of gameplay which in the movies would be annoying and maybe a little illogical, like the gas masks to protect from spores (which then they would just instantly remove the second they left a ""spore infected"" area even tho you could still see particles of spores in the air) and overall I think it's very fun to watch and interesting. The main actor, I loved him since appearing in the Mentalist and always figured he might become a big actor. The female girl actor tho ... ouch. As much as she was amazing and showed character when younger and in GoT, she's obnoxious and annoying at every step in this show. Even her face expressions which is what's mainly wrong with her, are more cringe than ""lovely fun teenager with an attitude"". She's just NOT ELLIE. Which is very sad since she's talented and the show is really great, guess we're stuck with her unless we fast forward at one point and she's older."

It's of course still a zombie movie that has just enough action to keep you interested. The zombies seem to come out of holes in the ground and it gets weirder.

This is also a vehicle to elevate Pedro Pascal into superstar status in the U. S. He's okay. The girl is okay, too-the latest overhyped product on the assembly line of child stars...

The story starts off slowly then it rebuilds itself back to the roots of a video game adaptation. The setting mainly takes place in old, dilapidated buildings. Full of bodies and cordyceps fungi. I would recommend this show as a 15+ not kid friendly. In terms of the profanity used within the show itself. Very good indeed."

The show drags on...it's paced well enough but still I just feel like I'm going nowhere fast.

Nothing happens in this show. Nothing of substance. It's your classic if zombies take over, humans will become more horrible than the monsters and kids will die sad and horrible deaths.

Just indulging the nightmare.

And for what reason? What is the reason? I'm honestly curious why this story is so appealing it has be told again and again...

Casting, acting, and production are all solid. Zombie concept and design is all very intriguing, but after 5 episodes of little revealed about the zombies and the focus being much more on the humans and the many ways they fail each other, it's clear what the true focus of this show is...much like The Walking Dead-excellent show, but very fatalistic, very doom and gloom, very people are inherently horrible. And I'm not interested in that.

I write this review purely for those like me. If you prefer World War Z zombie films...something more redemptive, this is not it.

And in general, a caution to others, just be careful what you feed your soul. This may be fiction, but stories are valuable because they make us feel things. So be careful with shows like this. The tone is sad, depressing, lonely, dark, hopeless. Depending on your personal/interpersonal struggles, this may not be a healthy choice for your viewing.

Permalink";"""The Last of Us"" is a zombie show that offers an interesting premise and solid acting performances, particularly from the two leads, Joel and Ellie. The show's depiction of the infected is more comical than fearsome, which may be disappointing for fans of the genre who are seeking a more terrifying experience.

The lack of action is notable, and while it is not necessarily a bad thing, it would have been preferable if it had been balanced by more interesting dialogue, character development, or plot advancement. Additionally, Ellie's character can be grating at times, which may detract from viewers' enjoyment of the show.

While ""The Last of Us"" has its strengths, there is also much room for improvement. The plot can feel generic and uninspired at times, and it fails to stand out from other stories in the same genre."

I love episode 3 as a standalone episode for the Walking Dead, but it does not fit in a small season with so much to tell, Bill was a 10 minute character in the game, afterwards we do not hear or see anything of him, just like in the show. But still we spend a full ep on him.

In general the world is empty, lack of feeling in danger.

You did not have to take every action scene of the game, but you left out so much of them. One would allost forget they live in an infected world!

Bella is great, not as Ellie tho.

Pedro is great, but his Joel isnt that cold as Joel was in the first game. Certainly seeing the dinner with Bill in a flashback. No way!

I fear next week episode will not give me the evolution Ellie is about to undergo. But we will see.

After saying that, I do think it's a pretty decent show. It's got a ton of money thrown at it, so it looks great, and Pedro is, as always, a great actor. The girl, although is another matter. She jokes around the whole time and takes nothing serious. It's like she's in a comedy and not in a horror show.

Two other things bug me about the show. One, it's not scary at all. Two, in Episode 5 we got a new mutant fungi zombie that was very ""Boss Battle"" video game like. It just ruined any type of post-apocalyptical fantasy I was living in and immediately threw me into a video game.

I was a big fan of The Walking Dead early seasons, and it was scary, and it dealt with character development (which is almost completely missing from this show), so the fancy special effects and big sets are not going to do it for me. Or maybe I'm just burned out on the zombie apocalypse genre.

When I heard they were doing a tv show I was more than skeptical about everything from the casting to the whole thing because given the kind of videogames adaptations we got so far I wasn't very thrilled but I told myself I'd give it a chance when it came out. And I'm glad I did, this is by far the best adaptation from a videogame I've seen so far and I couldn't be happier. I can definitely tell Craig Mazin is a fan and the fact that Neil is on board as well makes it even better and more authentic. Don't listen to people that are complaining about everything, yes they cut some parts yes they ADAPTED others but overall they haven't changed the essence of this story so I feel like that's where every adaptation goes wrong because they don't respect the story they try to innovate and change everything that makes the story not the same story anymore so that's where the problem lies, you have to respect the story, honor those characters and do right by the original and. It try to make it something it never was or change fundamental story plots to make it more edgy or whatnot, just follow the story everyone loved and make it accessible for people that don't play videogames as well and everyone will be happy. I love this show and I'm so happy they made this well! Give it a shot and be open minded and get ready for a roller coaster of emotions!"

To all those crying about Nick Offerman's character; chill out. It's called ""range"" you dorks. He's more than just a one-dimension, archetype actor. Unpopular opinion; that episode was sooooo boring. You're focusing on the wrong thing!!!

Anyway, the show is like a watching a firecracker that's probably never gonna pop. The whole season can be compiled into a full 20 minutes of dialogue. Am I watching planet earth or a seaman series? Like really?

I'm so tired of having a 45 minute walk with 2 minutes of talking and 10 minutes of credits."

You never know what direction this show is going to go into and it really throws you some curveballs.

I really liked the way the world gets infected, clever idea and it touches on logic in a way, especially against an unopposed enemy. The series is not a frantic and boring zombie attack but a character development series that plays with loss and emotions quite a bit. I'd say it's closer to the reality of a pandemic than a repeated attack by the living dead. Anyway it would be boring if there was only action and monotony. The shows that did that have been gone for 20 years, maybe they'll come back when the industry gets bored and people want a lot of action with no character explanation."

Not going to lie, a bit apprehensive at first on how they would change, what can be somewhat of a lengthy game into such a short season but they've pulled it off so far, beautifully. As a huge fan on the games, I was intrigued to watch and now I hate having to wait a week to see the next episode - even though I know what's going to happen! I want to see our actor/actress play it out and there are some changes of how they carried out in the game but they've done a brilliant job with these changes. Honestly, absolutely brilliant. I can't wait for season 2. The second game is longer, so I'm hoping they play it out more. The actors/actresses should NOT be changed! They're perfect for their roles... Except Joel's brother, he's great but I think he was the wrong choice. Doesn't bring my rating down at all though, just think someone else should be playing that role, considering it's a bigger role in the second game but maybe I'm wrong in my opinion. Keep it up! Keep it going! Great series!"

Doesn't deserve a 9 or 10 but it's decent entertainment and better than the likes of walking dead. Characters are arguably better and storylines better too, as with the scenes. Let's see how the show continues and what new things , unpredictable , original story could be developed."

Giving an 8 so far as the show is predictable for someone who has played the game though they try their best to add some variations here and there, and also because of the casting for Ellie in particular.

I'm not really a fan of Bella Ramsey as an actor. I just found her character annoying in game of thrones and here too. She also has a really annoying and punchable face."

There are little changes that they are just fine, so anyone should bear them.

Chapter 3 is a rainbow unicorn between all these chapters, but it's all right.

The content of the serie is great on many aspects: The photography, the acting, the casting, scenario & decoration, the locations, the action and the silences are excelent AND the script it follows the original content on most of the Key moments, so it shows the universe of The Last Of Us as expected and better.

For sure it's a serie it can be watched even if you played the game, and it's made with quality enough to rewatch or just set the universe for spin-offs if intended."

Hugh Jackman would have been the perfect casting for Joel. Imagine a copy of Jackman's character from Prisoners slaughtering bandits and dealing with tickers. Bella Ramsey as Ellie overdoes the awkward use of swearing to the max for no fault of her own. The dynamic between the two main characters is not fleshed out enough and makes for awkward viewing.

My assumption was that this was the end of the world, and anywhere and everywhere is dangerous. Never have I seen two people more safe, relaxed, and happy in an apocalypse scenario than I do with these two. Zero tension.

I have so many gripes with a variety of scenes in this series which I won't include to evade spoilers."

Permalink";"I have never played the video games, so my review is based entirely on the show. ""The Last of Us"" has a slow and intense start that kept me on edge. I think that the pilot is the perfect example on how you should build tension and suspense. The show goes on by developing the characters and the first two episodes are well balanced, because they have captivating dialogues and a good adrenaline dose as well. The third one was very discussed. I personally enjoyed it and despite being a bit too long, it was a well crafted filler. The acting by Nick Offerman and Murray Bartlett was just unbelievably good. It expanded the narration beyond the main storyline. However, I feel that the series took too many bad turns: it often lost the focus with overly long and uninteresting interactions that do not add any value, and it insisted on useless details. The pace is at times way too slow, for the sake of being ""deep"". A bit more action would benefit the series.

I really enjoyed the relationship between Joel and Ellie. It was interesting and I really cared about them. In general, all the characters were well developed, even the secondary ones, and there were many emotional moments that got me by surprise. Pedro Pascal is always a guarantee when it comes to acting. It is the first time that I see Bella Ramsey; she did overall a good job, even though her acting felt forced at times. After many episodes, I think that she was not the best fit for this role. Finally, the locations and the sets are well realized and they look pretty realistic. I think that this show was way too over acclaimed, due to its popularity, but it suffers from many issues that are common also in ""The Walking Dead"". Obviously not at the same level, but the boredom is sometimes palpable. With that being said, I definitely recommend the series, especially to fans of the game, but do not expect a big masterpiece, as highlighted by the general rating."

Unfortunatly the second one was already much worse, I felt no emotional connection to any of the characters and the acting wasn't all that convincing. On to episode three, where things got better but not in the way it should happen. I felt it was too early for a throwback with side-characters, although I did enjoy it. It had the emotional depth that you almost mistook it for the main storyline. All in all I am quite dissapointed that it happened to be this after all the hype I read. It's okay to watch, but for sure not anywhere close to the best show i've ever watched according to some people."

It's a 10/10 show.

But I do have to state an opinion that may not be popular. Bella Ramsey is not the best fit to play Ellie. Bella is an amazing actor but they are not melancholy enough. Bella's natural upbeat personality is shining through too much in the character of Ellie. Ellie, was a deep, sad, melancholy young woman. Which is 100% fitting given the circumstances. I crave this so much from the Ellie in the show, but it just keeps missing the mark. I felt so strongly connected to Ellie's emotional state when I played the games. I am not able to feel this connection to Bella."

Permalink";"Some of the shows elements such as the design, special effects, and cinematography all work together to create a deeply immersive and believable post-apocalyptic world. The show's attention to detail and commitment to realism is impressive. Some of the story beats and visuals are perfect and stunning; however, I've seen enough, and there is more net negative than positive.

Bella Ramsey as Ellie. I mean, come on. They might as well have cast Carrot Top as Nathan Drake. I mean, she looks about as much like the character as I look like the King of England. And the writing for her is like they took the original script and put it through a blender with some soy milk and a dash of entitlement. I'm pretty sure I've heard better acting in a middle school play.

Pedro Pascal as Joel? I was hoping for someone with more grit and less glitter. He's lost his edge and his attitude, and he's more likely to cry in the fetal position than fight. It's like he's Ellie's bumbling sidekick, not her protector and father figure. Joel is one of the most iconic characters in gaming history, and they've turned him into a shell of his former self. The writers seem to have forgotten what made him great in the first place - his strength, his determination, and his willingness to do whatever it takes to survive.

With all the girl bosses in the show, it's like they're trying to compensate for something. Look, I'm all for strong female characters, but a Karen from HR leading a group of survivors? That's like putting Gwyneth Paltrow in charge of a science lab.

I'm all for inclusivity and diversity, but when you're trying so hard to check all the boxes, it comes off as more forced than a vegan at a BBQ joint. And let's not forget about the pacing of the show. They spend so much time on side characters and subplots that it takes away from the real tension and action of the game. It's like they're trying to pad out the runtime to make it seem more important than it really is. Newsflash, writers: we can tell when you're stalling for time and overreaching for nominations.

Overall, ""The Last of Us"" TV show is a mess. It's like they took a masterpiece and scribbled all over it with a crayon and then gave it a lobotomy. There are better ways to spend your time. Like counting grains of sand on the beach."

After this we really lost interest and the show became very generic and filled with boring characters who die quickly, bad acting and massive plot armour to keep the two protagonists alive.

Joel is very dull and without any flavour and Ellie is extremely unlikeable and the constant swearing kept distracting me from the show.

Hollywood fully knows and understand what you want to see, but then they have their own agenda on what THEY WANT you to see. So they ween it in very strategically. Watch the first 2 episodes and pump up your ratings to deliver your garbage in the 3rd episode. So my advice to you? Skip the 3rd. And let's see what they have in store for us after that. I'm assuming they will not want to be the 3rd show's identity forever so they will defer back to the zombies and great acting before they lose 50% of their viewers.

I thought numerous times that it would make for a remarkable TV show, so when the announcement was made that HBO was indeed going to adapt it, I was ecstatic. Granted, adapting any story from its original form, especially when that original was able to tell a much longer and fuller story, there are concerns. I began to wonder how well they could tell this story and make it just as important as the game felt. In the game you were the characters much more so than you can make the viewer of any movie or TV show. At the time of this review, the first 6 episodes have been released and I've loved every single one of them. Are there pieces left out? Absolutely, but adapting into a shorter form of the story, that was necessary. Are you still as connected to the characters? Yes, in this you're able to connect to more than just the two characters you play as in the game. The fact that Neil Druckman still had so much involvement in this was a sure sign that this story would be respected and only improvements would be made."

Permalink";"I understand that after the disappointment that became The Walking Dead universe, anything even marginally better in this genre is going to be welcomed with open arms. The Last of Us is a melancholy affair.

The premise is really about loss - loss of family, loss of lovers, loss of civilisation, etc. To this end the series captures that mood very well. I don't mind there being long intervals between action sequences because it makes them all the more compelling when they arrive.

I have only had a brief association with the game, so I don't sit there comparing scenes whilst I watch. Overall, it seems to capture the mood of the game which is better than trying to reproduce the game scene by scene and allows a freedom to where they want to take the story.

So, given they are taking a relaxed approach to allowing events to unfold, how is the show going so far - 6 episodes in? Well, entertaining, but not compelling would be my take on it. Compared to a similarly themed series - Black Summer - it is more measured, but less addictive. Perhaps this is due to dropping one a week rather than the whole season at once to binge. Maybe those that have been able to hold off until the last episode is aired will benefit from their patience, but I think the frenetic quality that permeates Black Summer does serve this genre well. I appreciate the melancholic mood the producers have created for this show, but there isn't much of a feeling of menace from a world that has been turned on its head.

The threat of death around every corner is just not that evident thus far.

Ultimately, this is a show worth watching and holds more promise than Walking Dead (or any of its offshoots), but whilst it ticks a few of the boxes we expect from a show of this sort, it lacks much of the suspense and tension."

Permalink";"First off: I don't know the videogame. Never played it, saw it or heard of it. So I never actually planned to see this show but the reviews were so extremely good that I had to find out for myself what made this so geniously good.

By the end of episode 3 I can honestly tell you: I haven't got a single clue!!

My god, it's like the next season of The Walking Dead and we've had an overdosis of dat already. It simply had nothing new to offer. I've seen this all before. Zombies, people building fences around villages and growing their own vegetables.. BORING!

Tedious ""Bold and the Beautiful"" like conversations dragging on and I'm wondering all the time: WHY? Why make this show? What new does it bring to the table? It's all been done before.. and not just once.

Most annoying so far is that horrible 14 year old stupid girl. What a poor casting. I wanted to shoot her within 10 minutes and kept hoping something bad would happen to her..

All those halleluja reviews are part of a mass hysteria.. It must be, because this is totally overrated. It's just NOT VERY GOOD."

This together with the generally slow pace and jumping up and down between tones really doesn't do it any favours. First episode was actually ok, but then it just became more and more boring with each week. It's a zombie show after all, I was expecring to get some more excitmemt from it. You are for sure better off playing the game or watching the cinematics for it if you like something more engaging and thrilling (nd I guess that revisiting the game recently made the tv show even worse in comparison). Each will have it's own preference in the end and for sure the show does not have to be a mirror image of the game, but for me personally is a huge fail. I abandoned it mid episode six and this is it."

The pacing is very slow and not anything like the creepiness of the game. The young actress Bella Ramsey seems miscast and a little disappointing. I am surprised it rates so highly. I will stick with it until the end but it has now become a hard slog.

I am hoping the pace will pick up and it will become scarier as I am fighting to awake it's so slow and boring. I found the game so scary at times and have yet to be scared with the tv show . Here's hoping it gets better."

But the dialogue can be boring and I often need more action. However when the action occurs it is tense. First off I thought Ellie (Ramsey) was quite annoying but she really grows and does an amazing performance. You can almost tell she developed as a better actress during the show.

The infected are terrifying and they look perfectly alike like the games. I also just wished Joel was more violent both towards the infected and enemies. The brutality like in the games is a bit lacky. And I could have hoped for some more memorable moments in the show from the game (the basement generator thing). ;)"

There is no chemistry between joel and Ellie, Bella ramsay is a miscast, almost each episode new characters from the game introduced and some serious screen time is being spent on their development instead of Joel and ellie. That's why I would call this one ""chronicles"" instead of The Last of us because it's only a glimpse of the game. Small pieces cannot be hold together because main character development sacrificed over character variety. It simply doesn't give me the excitement of waiting new episodes. If it doesn't give me the excitement as a fan of the game, I cannot imagine people who haven't play the game."

I wish the episodes were more than 1 hour long. By the way, I didn't play or see the game version of it. It's a pure thriller with action and sentiment.

And utterly predictable. The character progression is dreary and formulaic and the characters are canned stereotypes.

Watching episode 5 atm, while writing this. About to hit the fast forward since not one thing has been said in 20 minutes that wasn't predictable and obvious. Total waste of time.

So far every episode has been 10-15 minutes worth of show drawn out to a painful hour. If they don't seriously pick it up I'm out. I can't see that happening though. This is just going to keep plodding along, yawn after predictable yawn.

Don't get me wrong. This has real potential, even with the predictability. But for predictable TV it is ugh, waaaaay toooooo slooooooow.

Be warned, this is 80% predictable snoozefest."

Neil Druckmann and Craig Mazin took an already incredible story and improved it--like freaking wizards, Harry. Compared to the original game, everything has more depth. Side characters don't pass moments but spotlight experience and emotions. You end up more invested. Stakes are raised higher. If there's loss, you feel it with them. I'm not crying, you are.

I'm coming off just the start of the second half of the first series--in a heroes journey, the stakes are at maximum and the protagonists must reflect and grow from sudden trauma. But really, Joesph Campbell should've taken notes from Neil Druckmann.

Signed. With love. Another stan-boy."

Permalink";"As a huge fan of the video games, I was really looking forward to this show. Knowing how video game adaptations usually turn out, I was also skeptical.

IMO this is the best video game adaptation so far, but it's not as good as the game.

While watching this show I constantly found myself thinking ""Why did they change this scene? Why did they change this line of dialogue? Why did they change this character's motivation for doing X? Why did they add this character? Why this new side-plot?"" IMO most of it didn't improve the story, but made it worse.

Looking at the season as a whole, it had a strong start, then got really mediocre, but picked up again for the finale.

I gotta say there is a lot going right in this show. Pedro Pascal is great as Joel and most of the other characters are well written and acted. The sets are really well done, and the cinematography is adept at framing each scene.

The first two episodes were really great, and I had hope it would get better.

The third episode, while touching, leaned a little heavily into the male on male action. Just not really something I wanted to see in a horror/zombie show. THEN I find out the director, who's gay went online to brag about how he tricked everyone into watching a gay romance. That's just obnoxious, agenda driven and kinda takes away from the fact it was a well directed episode. Nick Offermans dedication really helped. Still had little to do with the main storyline.

Then we get to episode 4 and this is where I finally had enough of Ellie. I'm not sure if it's Bella Ramsey, or the writing but she is not believable at all. I had tolerated it the first few episodes because everything else was good. I mean she's supposed to be a teenager in a zombie apocalypse. I get she grew up in it, but she still seems to lack any emotion besides snarky whip smart kid. She takes me out of scenes where she would realistically be afraid. She talks to Joel in an obnoxious to that just doesn't fit the tone of scene. It just becomes more apparent as the episode progresses and I just started doing housework and other things. So I can't say I watched much of episodes 4 and 5...

My other gripe is its just not scary. The monsters just feel too cgi. I don't know I just felt the clickers didn't do it for me.

Might give it another shot, but damn I feel like Ellie was badly written and miscast. She takes me out of an otherwise well made show."

I wish for more seasons for this series , its quite good to enjoy on weekend , nice scene , and funny.

The zombie: Without remorse and pity, driven by a single hunger, and damn near impossible to put down permanently. There have been times since their introduction into movies in the 1930s where it felt like we'd never see a zombie movie again. Then there are eras of the opposite, where you couldn't stick your arm out in a multiplex without a shambling ghoul nearby, ready to chomp. And since we've been in feast mode over the last decade-plus, we're taking a big bite with our guide to the 30 Essential Zombie Movies that you need to watch!

While zombie movies have been for more than 80 years (in 1932 we got White Zombie, in 1943 I Walked With a Zombie), it's commonly accepted the subgenre as we know it today didn't rise until 1968, when George A. Romero unleashed Night of the Living Dead. An independent film with a budget barely above six figures, Night enthralled audiences with its mysterious plot, shocking gore, progressive casting and social commentary, and, natch, the unforgettable hordes of the gaunt, hungry undead. Crowned the godfather of zombies, Romero made five more Dead movies, the best of which are featured in this guide, including Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead."

I think the show has stayed true to most of the source material. The scenery and shots are just like the game which I appreciate.

I think Pedro Pascal is a great actor and does a good job. Bella Ramsay is okay in the show. Bill should have been given a better story arc like the game.

Still the cast feels off-putting to me. I think Hugh Jackman and Kaitlyn Dever would have been a perfect cast for Joel and Ellie looks-wise. (I do get not everything has to be like the source material).

The show has definitely improved since episode 5 (best episode so far). I'll keep watching, but for now I will give it a 7 out of 10."

Permalink";"A 9.2 would indicate this tv show is one of the best of all time, it's extraordinarily pretty but in terms of content and execution it's not really hit the mark for me to even talk about it with the better shows in this generation.

Familiarity breeds problems, same as people who read always hate on movie versions, I don't think this translated as well as it could've done. Sometimes it's warranted but truthfully just feel they want to get multiple series and as much money out of it as possible.

With tv and movies struggling for ideas or fresh hits they'll take anything available and a near perfect video game with a high percentage of cinematography is ideal, that's probably who's fanboying this to such a high mark, if you've played the game, so much of this story is spoilt plus will real life look as good as high def 1080p graphics? Probably not.

Then there's the casting, Ellie and the daughter were both decent although I don't understand why she needed to swear so much? It felt genuinely unnecessary and I'm not someone who cares about language but it just felt needless. Joel's casting wasn't great, no presence, weak voice, no power! The rest are mediocre or below with one or two exceptions but no one here blows your mind.

Episode 3, I'm torn on this, was it well acted? Yeah! Did it tell a nice story? Yeah! Did it introduce and kill off characters too quickly? Yes, did it feel like a filler episode and were only on episode 3? Yes indeed! The other glaring issue was whether or not this was just done for woke point scoring, I'm going to say a tiny bit but more I think for padding it out to get a second season.

Another show that needs far more action than it shows and far more focused stories. Personally a 12-15 1 season split into two parts would be fine . Not into padding out stuff. Why every franchise needs to be throttled to death to kill every penny is depressing.

Mediocre show, overrated by the gamers."

TLOU is a devalued version of the game , the cast and the script are awful , the new characters are ""tasteless"" , the action is almost non existent, in case you didn't notice, this is a show about infected and survivors without them ; only a couple of minutes of action , no blood , no tension, no horror....... Nothing happens, at least nothing worth watching.

The only thing good is the OST of Santaolalla......but 9,2 is a joke por shows like Breaking bad , The Wire , The Sopranos, BCS , Boardwalk Empire, etcetc."

Permalink";"It started off interesting, only to turn out to be another standard series that gradually got worse and worse as time went on.

The beginning was solid, the characters and environment were interesting, and the series promised us a lot of action. A promise that was not fulfilled.

Bearing in mind that the casting could have been much, much better, it could have been much, much worse. We have already seen that in other shows.

The first episode was also the best, the rest is gradually getting worse. Already in the third episode we have a filler episode. I fast forwarded most of the episode anyway, it was just too boring.

Kathleen, the character played by Melanie Lynskey, is so hilariously unconvincing as some kind of leader of these villainous characters that I felt like I was watching a parody. It only further lowered the impression of the whole show.

The action parts are fun and well directed, but there are simply too few of them and the series feels dragged out. The entertainment industry has nothing to do with entertainment anymore.

Mediocre writers and directors, as well as some other things ruined the fun.

This series really could have been great, but in the end, it's just another overrated mediocre show."

Of course there are some differences that seperates the game from the series but I believe that if these differences are done greatly they would make the series even better. And in this series the differences are very well made and they dont change much about the story. Before the series even start when I saw the actors list I was kind of disappointed but we're in the 5th episode and I can say that I was wrong. Both Bella Ramsey and Pedro Pascal did very well with their roles and played them perfectly. For me this is a kind of series that anyone (even if they dont know anything about the game) can watch and enjoy at its fullest."

b-level CGI


It's salvaged by very solid acting and some fun twists, but the woke sprinkles which is ravaging the industry are spread on so heavy-handed at times you'll wonder if you're watching TV or a PSA against a certain political view.

The show is also very self aware, so this is no accident. Lines are dropped here and there to mock a certain US party of the USA, leaving the rest of the world scratching their heads.

Overall, it's acceptable but relatively poor television.

Watch 'black mirror' for much better dystopian sci-fi."

We are grateful for these blessings in the otherwise heaps of garbage however occasionally you get a show that you know you are gonna watch again two or three times in your life because it is so well crafted, acted and cared about, The Last of Us is one of those shows.

We are only half way through the first season but I can tell the people who make this show care so much, I have every faith in what they are doing with the source material. This is the best tv I have watched since about seasons 4 of Game of Thrones.

I never recommend shows to anyone, even the best stuff ever like The Sopranos I don't talk to people about it because some of the storytelling can be a bit too meta for people.

We're on episode 5 of 9 over halfway through and nothing super memorable has happened. The first several episodes we don't get much action with a few notable big pieces but now episode 5 we're just starting to get some actual fighting. The assumption is if you're watching you played the game and while this makes sense for some, it really limits your demographic.

At first i didn't love Bella as Ellie. I thought she was too vulgar and hard edged.... But I think they found her stride as the show goes on. You see the kinder, more sensitive and vulnerable side of her.

Every episode is paced wonderfully. They keep the tention up and the plot moving forward great. I just really love that there is such a good show being made based on a popular pre-existing medium... done the right way.

TLOU game developers did a better job telling the story than whoever made this crap. At least they could've tried to find a girl that looks more like the real Ellie because I just cannot picture Bella Ramsey playing Ellie in the second part where she's all grown up. The actress, even though an adult already, looks like a child. It's gonna be weird."

The precision in this movie is insane. The Easter eggs, the acting, the costume choices are all intelligent, precise, and magnificent.

I want to mention the Easter eggs, but its best for you to discover them yourself.

I can't praise this enough. This is a masterpiece created by a true genius of cinema. It's an intelligent, well thought out labor of love.

The only thing I feel like they missed is capturing the same fear a bloater gives you in the game. Perhaps that is yet to come. As of now only 5 episodes have been released. It would be a shame not to capture the terror of that creature that the game did so well. I realize it is in there but, it just wasn't as scary as it was in the game. Minor gripe."

What I love the most about the series is how it stays authentic to the source material, (for me is the game idk if there are/were books before), but still manage to change what seem like small details that pack a punch. I mean it really catches you by surprise and give a fresh feeling but than again giving you that safe and comfortable feeling that you're within the game's story. It truly is amazing.

Pedro Pascal is Joel no doubt about it!

Nothing more to add...

What about Ellie? I need to learn the actress's name. Bella Ramsey.

Jesus she nails it, she really does justice for her character and more. That little rebel/rascal, with a big heart, and smart intuitive kid. Great work Bella!

Also not to take for granted is the amazing cgi.

I just bought the The last of us 1 on ps5 had it on the ps3 and ps4 watching this reminds me of missions that you had to do and tonight's ep#5 was too good. It was like I was watching myself play the game. They couldn't have picked better actors, pascal is great in anything but he really captures Joel. I wasn't sold on Bella at first but 5 eps in she's a great Ellie I can't wait to see how the rest of the season plays out and I can already see how they are letting Joel acquire better weapons...if you never played the game even better."

Thus far they've treated the game with absolute respect, big variations with bill but good ones. I always wanted that game to reach more people. People that wouldn't take the time or have the ability to get through a game. Never thought this incredible story would be shared with a huge audience like it is. Zombie shows are a genre that is flooded, but this story is a love story with zombies circling around. After recently having a daughter it's even more impactful than the ten times I've played it. Thanks to everyone involved, what an incredible job."

It's not. I have fallen asleep on 3 out of the 5 episodes. I find it slow. It has a terribly weak story line. The characters aren't like-able. The zombies aren't scary. It's just an overall ""Meh"" show. No repeat value.

I'm a fan of many great TV series. Game of Thrones. Sopranos. Breaking Bad. Vikings. These are all deserving of a 9-10 rating. TLOU is nowhere near that caliber of writing, acting, or character development. People need to give it more time before providing such misleading ratings."

Bella Ramsey is a brilliant actress, she is so good playing her part and totally believable. A rebellious teenager, full of energy with angst towards the dark world surrounding her. Doesn't give a hoot what you think and is ready to jump in and take you on.

Every season has its own storyline, it pulls me in then throws me out with shock and devastation. Every week I'm left feeling bewildered and pondering about characters and how they made me feel. The writers are geniuses.

I love watching Pedro Pascal! He needs no words!

The main problem TWD has, is that Zombies are slow, which makes it very boring to watch and most of the time humans only died to Zombies, when theyve made a stupid mistake. Like running and falling and breaking their leg. In ""The Last of Us"" this isnt the case. The ""Zombies"" can run, and they are strong as well, which makes the show much more exciting than shows like TWD.

The camera movements and perspectives are great. You can see that the creators of the show paid a lot of attention to details.

Pedro Pascal is killing the role as main actor. I already liked him a lot, when he was playing The Mandalorien. Hes the perfect fit.

Overall, a refreshing new concept of a ""Zombie"" TV show without the annoying cliffhangers, TWD has every episode.

So far, this show deserves a 10/10 from me."

This series incorporates themes from Children of Men (2006) and various post-apocalyptic road films, but does not rise to the level of the best of any of them. I am 5 episodes into the series and there are already some minor problems with the series, although it is highly watchable overall. The acting is decent, and some of the characters more likeable than others. Full disclosure, I haven't played the video game and was not even familiar with it before watching this series. It's a good series, but it's not worthy of an 8+ IMDB rating."

I went into this and watched first couple episodes. Like many other shows of this nature people make some very weird choices that in a real situation I don't think they would make. My main concern was that it would be the walking dead all over again. A drama that once in awhile had zombies. And so far that's what its been. While the second episode was interesting Im sorry I cant see Nick Offerman as gay. Just cant do it and for him to give a good shot at it shows what a good actor he actually is. The main character has all this stuff that he left behind, gun ammo and he doesn't take most of it? A little more break down on how and what happens to the affected would be nice. I think they use zombies for these movies because things don't get blown up or under 100 ft of water like in a natural disaster of the type for an apocalypse but that leaves you having to explain some things. SO far this is a good DRAMA series but I doubt it will be any different then TWD. And Joel is not a hero he is narcist and him saving ellie at the end doomed everything."

Permalink";"Never played the games. You can feel the big budget from the quality of the cinematography and the story is taken up a good few notches by way of quality acting... from almost everyone.

As Bella Ramsey gets more comfortable in the role her arrogance is palpable. As I was watching, her performance felt out of place, unrelated to the character she was playing, which lead me to look the TLOU original story and lookup Ellie.

Indeed, it turns out, part one is about a young Ellie, experiencing a transformative journey full of trauma and internal growing. We are instead treated to a young actress that seems preoccupied more with gratuitous cursing and weird fake acting than finding the core of Ellie's character and taking the audience through that journey.

BR had an interesting challenge to undertake, which she dismissed far to easily: it would have been quite the feat to play a weak, timid, innocent Ellie that learns through exposure and hardship, transforming through the episodes before our eyes. BR could've sought senior advice on how to put that into practice. Her coaching in GOT was far better, even though at a young age, she managed to put on enough credibility to sell her difficult role.

I am very sorry that arrogance got her off track and deprived us the audience of what could have been an otherwise excellent series.

As episodes progress my rating of this drops, last episode was awesome as BR had very few lines, yet she is too central to the whole show for me to hope to endure till the end, let alone embark on season 2."

The acting and casting in the game is far superior. Ellie is un-likeable in this TV version, very poor casting of such a key character. She was the hero in the game, funny, lovable, honest, now I find here annoying. The same goes for the casting on Sarah, Triss and Tommy for different reasons.

It seemed so simple to me how to embellish on the game without compromising the story and pacing but the direction taken in the first 4 episodes doesn't do the source material justice. The music in the game was spot on, timed impeccably, on TV it seems out of place. The set design was unbelievable in the game, on TV it's basic and rushed in comparison.

Maybe I can only see the characters in there original light, and within a game you can create a better atmospheric vibe over longer segments, build emotional connections easier over a shared experience but there are plenty movies out there which hit these marks for me and unfortunately this isn't one.

I'll keep watching for sure, but I'm looking forward to LOU Part 3 on the PlayStation more than anymore of this. Maybe a full on animation of the last of us would of been better suited for me."

The impressive sets didn't impress any more than most other sci-fi shows. The tight camera work with a lot of close up that seem to be there to raise the tension, have been obvious and noticeable and distracting from the first episode.

The acting is good and the interaction of the characters with each other is well done.

I turned it off in the middle of the 5th episode and though ""eh, not for me"".

Incidentally I loved The Leftovers and the German series Dark. And there's always rewatching the excellent episodes of Fargo to cheer me up."

I saw people put ""it's like any other apocalypse show/movie"" well then you come up with something new. The Infected aren't like the typical zombies we've seen, it shows way more of the dark side of humans, and the start of the outbreak was different than a normal virus outbreak.

I'm not a gamer so I don't know what kind of crossover appeal it may have to those that are. It just seems so far like it's just another apocalyptic, pandemic zombie show in a long line of them. Maybe that will change, and they'll twist things up, but for now, I think we've pretty much seen this before. It is well done, but probably gets a little ding for originality."

But from the moment the casting was announced my hopes for the show just kept sinking and sinking. Pedro Pascal as Joel is okay, not a great choice, not a terrible one either. But Bella Ramsey is just the biggest miscasting ever.

I tried to like it, I watched the first few episodes, but it is so much worse than expected. This non-Ellie is just a bad joke. If the show was realistic, Joel would push this Ellie into the next group of clickers. In the final episode Joel would just shrug and go home instead of what he did in the games.

I just hope that I'll live long enough to see someone else do a better version of this show, maybe in many years, once the third game has been released and the story is finished."

I do not enjoy cinematic style of characters faced with adversity then acting impulsively and stupidly. So why sit through this crap?! It's been done already, beaten to death far too many times to count. I. E. War of the Worlds (the Tom Cruise edition). This time, it's ""zombies"" through upgraded to pathogen infected humans, their minds commandeered into...well, zombies pretty much. So the main characters are posed to be above others, with a better will to survive and we HOPE the smarts to get past the situation. Nope. Hmm - we're better off HERE than most (said out loud even), sooooo leave there immediately!? DON'T take precious time to assemble the most basic provisions, just drive the crap out of a truck, speeding here and there, ever thrusting themselves closer to the a dramatically and obviously far worse place after place. Tom Cruise in WotW drove his family into the crowds in his van, these morons drove a truck. Woot. But get out of the truck to favor hand-to-hand combat with some of the apparently hundreds (implying thousands) of zombies, then just stand there in shock and disbelief. ""Get in the truck!"" Naw, that worked the best thus far so I'd rather just stand here cuz it's supposed to look good on camera. This was based on a video game (of which I know nothing)? THAT makes more sense - you need things to shoot at. But for a movie? Why not just play the game instead? Or save a LOT of time and watch any of countless identical scenarios already puked up for your pleasure. And you could make that choice a movie - a couple of hours and DONE. This is anticipated to run multiple seasons? I hope for the sake of those that stick with this drivel that the story evolves into something at least a little bit more cerebrally entertaining. After all, the premise is promising - better than ""Martians"" attacking and the like."

To say this series is completely underwhelming would be an understatement. The first 20 minutes of the first episode were great, setting the scene for the unfolding pandemic. Everything after this, besides episode 5 which was the only noteworthy episode (definitely worth a 9/10) is by the numbers, slow paced, seen it all before but done better. Bella Ramsey's character Ellie, was instantly and continues to be dislikeable, with no redeeming features. Pedro Pascal as Joel is excellent but he is the only positive in this achingly tedious show. In episode 4 we were introduced to Kathleen played by the totally miscast Melanie Lynskey. The person responsible for casting in this show is clearly a poor judge of character. Even the action scenes are lacking tension or excitement. I stuck with it hoping for another episode as good as the fifth, but alas the next 3 episodes have left me bored stiff. So I'm I'm baffled by the high scores and positive reviews given to this show."

The performances by Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey are top-notch, bringing depth and nuance to their characters. The show also has strong supporting performances from actors such as Gabriel Luna, who plays Tommy, Joel's brother, and Danny Ramirez, who plays Jesse, a member of the Fireflies.

The show also does an excellent job of creating a sense of scale, making the world feel large and immersive. The attention to detail in the world-building is also impressive, with a well thought-out lore and believable world.

The show is also a powerful and emotional story in its own right, with a strong sense of hope and humanity in a world that is often bleak and hopeless. If you are a fan of post-apocalyptic stories, survival dramas, or just great storytelling, then you should definitely check out The Last of Us."

I was not sure about the casting at first, but ep 1 immediately calmed me down in that respect. Love the characters, their dynamic, the dialogue. I think this is the best game-to-tv adaptation I've ever seen. They made all the right choices and in my opinion ep 3 was one of the absolute best. I'm sure there are haters and people who want to see an absolute 1:1 story like the games, but they are /wrong/. Don't misunderstand me: I freaking love the games. Played them multiple times. And this adaptation is, in my opinion, very much doing them justice."

I don't support typecasting, but at the very least the actor should be the right fit - looks, physicality, voice, personality. Bella as Ellie, also a big mistake. Nico Parker would have been a much better choice. Yet, they went and used her for just one episode! Coming to episode 3, why???? It was totally out of place in this show and utterly superfluous. What were the makers thinking??! I have not seen the video games the show is based on, but the makers could have simply stuck as closely to that as possible since it was already a winner. I am certain there is a very large audience for the show outside of the gaming world. So, that shouldn't have posed a problem."

I stopped watching zombie movies long ago but when I saw the poster of this particular TV show, I felt compelled to watch it. There are no stereotypical characters and nothing can be taken for granted because everything is unexpected. The acting is great and the environment truly believable, I got completely raptured by the story. Many scenes are deliberately dark, sometimes a bit too dark for me, however the contrast with the scenes where some light manages to get through is evident to underline the fragile balance between fear and love. Great job!"

Out of all the choices, they pick her? Really hope she gets killed off soon. Sorry, not sorry.

Bella and Pedro work well together overall. Her character is sarcastic with a dash or profanity that you somehow relate to. The magnetism between them is powerful. Their dynamic alone is worth the watch. Scenes are well shot."

This show is a story about the human condition when the world is at its end. With a beautiful mix of desperation and bravery, these characters become more interesting every episode.

The acting is superb. Pedro and Bella have amazing energy together. A real father/daughter energy. The whole cast has sold every single scene. Nico Parker is a phenomenal actor. She makes you feel every line she says.

The sets and graphics are also really well done. Yes, even the graphics are really good. It very creepy/beautiful aesthetic that keeps an comfortably unsettled, dangerous feeling in the air. Lots of different locations effected differently so you get scenes with scores of things to pause the show and look at.

The characters show great representation for many POCs and minorities. A true picture of the real world rather than a whitewashed one.

The lines themselves are a bit predictable but that's my only complaint. The story is still very intriguing with great delivery.

Seriously, give it a real chance. Just remember, it's about humans WITH zombies, NOT zombies with humans."

Permalink";"The post-apocalyptic and dystopian type movies/shows have been at the top of my watch list since I was a teenager.

Some shows have been much better than others but with several episodes in I can definitely see why HBO has already signed them up for a second season. Hopefully they will sign for a third!

To me it got a little bit of a slow start but sometimes that's a good thing so they can establish who's who and make some character connections. There have been some observations that some of the technology, for example flashlights, might not be working (batteries) in 20 years after an apocalypse... not an invalid criticism.

I like that their take on the end of the world is more relationship based. In some ways it feels like station 11 where they didn't focus on the virus so much as they focused on the people's lives.

I'm super excited to see how things progress! So far so great!"

I'm not not a big romance fan. I don't even really get into romantic comedies that much. I am really enjoying the show! I wish the Resident Evil show on Netflix would have been this quality.

Permalink";"The show's production design takes many cues from the game, but the result is environments that can feel too manicured-the overgrowth on abandoned cars a bit too carefully placed, the moss in a patch of sunlight streaming through a collapsed roof too neatly lit, and the moments that pause on such sights a bit contrived in their attempt to aestheticize decay. The same details that can be so immersive in the game become mere window dressing for the apocalypse here, However, it became abundantly clear that my nerves were misplaced. Any viewer is in for a fantastic season of huge gut punches, terrifying set pieces, tender moments that will make you cry, and some fascinating changes to the core story that will challenge you - all the fundamentals that made the game so great.

Not every part of it hits with the same emotional ferocity that the games do, but this is proof that video game adaptations work, provided you do them right and you're willing to take some calculated risks with the source material. And good performance so far."

I don't really feel like most of the human population ended or that people are that deeply impacted by the sudden loss of all that life. A lot of that is the acting is pretty wooden and hollow. The young actress in particular isn't very convincing and there isn't a lot of chemistry between her and the main male character. I did think the third episodes was pretty emotionally manipulative and cheesy, but well acted. I recommend it for a binge but I don't think this is as good as many others say."

I was expecting something new in this series but have already seen 4 episodes and so far down hill. Another road movie with emotional and bad guys interruptions. The Cordyceps fungus concept is interesting, though.

Characters: Joel is ok, Ellie is annoying ( they should have used Nico Parker for her role and Bella Ramsey as Joel's daughter).

Nevertheless, will continue to watch each episode and hope there's a twist in the plot."

We explored the stories of various characters in the game, but some stories were untold, like that of Bill and Frank, which was beautifully shown in one of the episodes, and unlike the game we got to see their beautiful ending. It felt complete at that moment. We also got more understanding and depth of Joel and Tess's relationship. We also got to know how much older Joel is, and he is not a superhuman( like in the game) he is human, with impaired hearing and knee pain, which just added more sense and relatability to his character. Without wandering much away from the game, the series seems totally different and refreshing. It's completing the experience that we had from the game. And I believe for much of the audience that is not familiar with the game, will also won't feel left out and will enjoy this series. Watched four episodes till now, very much looking forward to completing this series."

Obviously a TV show has more time to explore parts of the story that might cause gameplay to drag. I'm in total support of the deeper dives into what gamers already knew of the story without taking away from the canon.

So far it's brilliantly executed!!! Actors have captured these characters perfectly. The scenes and landscape are what I remember from the game. I'm excited to see more & see how close to canon they remain, but it's so well done (so far), I imagine any more additions to the originally story will fit well and just enhance the narrative."

It is sad that many people will probably get their first experience of The Last of Us from watching this show, not knowing that the original story is so much more impactful. It is a fault of the casting, writing and direction.

If you haven't played the game then I encourage you to do so, or at least watch a playthrough on YouTube. The show could have been amazing but the writers have failed to recapture any of the original's magic."

I'm four episodes in and losing interest quickly. I really like Pedro Pascal and we can see him building a relationship with his travel partner, but it's moving too slow without many answers.

The only thing different is that the outbreak in this show was caused by Fungi and the Zombies cannot see and can move really fast to attack their victims. But otherwise just feels like watching a rehashed updated version of The Walking Dead so far - maybe things will change going forward but so far it's been very slow and ho hum.

But if gore, zombie, horror is the genre you like then it's a decent watch - but nothing great."

It's an adaptation for a reason, and it's really well done! The game itself is for a sure a masterpiece, I've played it many times, but I'm glad that the adaptation differs from the source material. It takes the emotion and wonder out of the show if we know every little detail that is about to happen. Also, a majority of the game is Joel and Ellie hiding behind cars and sniping bad guys and clickers so HBO needed to improvise material to make the show flow.

So far I am a big fan of the casting and I cannot wait to see Joel and Ellies relationship bloom. I can't wait for the boaters!"

Infected people infect the I infected and society collapses etc. It is done very well here although there is a flaw that I fear it will not be able to overcome. That flaw is they unlike in the video game, the main characters cannot die. This means that there is no tension to propel the plot along as you are aware that what ever is thrown at them; however tense the music gets; however much they scream; they WILL get through this. After all, if they don't the series ends. The interest so far (episode 2 as I write) lies in how the infected are portrait. So far we have had couple of good descriptions and a ""cauliflower head"".

So, a solid survivor plot with no real peril. It's hard to see how real tension can be generated here."

For instance, 10 miles West of Boston and the backdrop is that of the Rocky Mountains (filmed in Alberta!). And the buildings do have junk on the floors but the walls show fresh concrete after at least twenty years of in no use with ripped ceilings and water inflow and so on.

Permalink";"This is basically ""The Walking Dead"" mixed with ""The Road"" and has pieces of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" ""Z Nation,"" and a billion other post-apocalyptic movies. There is just enough originality though to keep most audiences happy.

The main characters are excellent. The girl is snarky and hilarious, but without the feeling that HBO is attempting to tailor TOO much to the younger generation. Joel is great too, but a bit too ""Mad Max.""

The plot is standard, and mildly predictable. There's a lot to be happy about, but a lot to make fun of. For example, why do the infected have to sound like the penguins from Futurama? And their movements are too.....exaggerated and typical. It's like it's too obvious they are just actors.

After the first couple episodes, it's apparent that it relies heavily on the dynamic between the two main characters. It does not disappoint. But again, I have to again think of the dozens of relationships in so many tv shows and movies that are almost exactly identical.

Despite my complaints of the show lacking in originality, it's fun and worth a watch. DO IT. But don't expect anything amazing.

My guess is the hype right now is high because of all the fanboys of the original game gushing over over the mere fact that the show was even made in the first place.

The show that was nothing short of a major disappointment. Extremely overrated and I do not see it, The show is a major disappointment. Completely, jumped the shark.

From start to finish, it was a dull and boring experience, failing to capture my interest or hold my attention. I would rate it a meager one star. I feel like I rated it too high, sorry about that.

The premise of the show may have started with a mildly intriguing notion, in the long run it lacked creativity. The characters were poorly developed and lacked depth, making it difficult to connect with them or care about their stories. The dialogue was stiff and unnatural, lacking the spark that makes good television so engaging.

The show's pace was painfully slow, with long stretches of inactivity that dragged on without end. The plot was predictable and lacked any real sense of tension or excitement. I found myself checking my watch repeatedly, counting down the minutes until it was over.

The production value had potential and then still found a way to ultimately come up short. The lighting had interesting moments, and then overall it was flat and uninteresting, and the special effects started out kind of interesting and ultimately were underwhelming. The music was forgettable and failed to add any real impact to the scenes. Forgettable.

The TV show was a waste of time. I cannot recommend it to anyone, regardless of their personal taste in television. It was dull, boring, lacking the elements that make good television so enjoyable. If you're looking for something to watch, I would suggest you look elsewhere, as this show is not worth your time or attention."

HBO hasn't had a really good show in a long time. Lately they've been buying up properties to adapt because they have a built in audience, but I'm guessing they always see a giant drop-off in around the 3rd and 4th episode.

Here we are four episodes into a series and I'm bored to tears. I WANTED to like this show, I forgave many stupid moments in the first two episodes, and then they completely wasted the third episode with a completely inconsequential story. It's like they have no idea that people are waiting to be DRAWN INTO their zombie show, which four episodes in has almost no zombies.

The ultimate Achilles heel of this show is that it hinges on the relationship between two incredibly dull characters. The edgy teenage girl character is extremely annoying, and I'd rather see the brooding martyr guy just dump her in a hole and go on being mopey than continue watching their story."

I'm thinking that Zombie movies/series have reached their apex and are on decline. Find the original Night of the Living Dead and you will see we have reached the end of an era."

The storyline is amazing, Bella as Ellie is honestly the best and anyone who says otherwise are wrong, they're portraying her amazingly.

And for anyone mad at the 3rd episode, y'all need to grow up. Why are grown men coming here and immediately rating it 1 star. If you would have actually paid attention to the story instead of concentrating on your homophobic thoughts i think a lot of you would have liked it. It was one of the rare tv shows stories that actually made me cry even though I didn't expect it at all and was in it to watch an apocalyptic show.

I can see this is a trend nowadays, but I report this cheap effect does not make me feel I'm there within the show nor makes the show more realistic, so I just don't get why filmmakers have to use it... Sad, they lost a viewer.

Regarding the content, I'm not a huge fan of zombie stories, but the base idea is fine. The pace of the show is also okay, not too fast, not too slow. The first few episodes that I managed to suffer through due to the shaking camera effect give back the atmosphere of the doomsday movies. There are jumps back and forth in time, but its easy to follow. It quickly turns out what will drive the first season."

This is a mediocre show at best. The setting , the acting and the dialogues remind a lot of the older Stephan king low budget 3 part mini series we used to watch in the 90s such as The stand from 1994.

The apocalyptic setting looks nice but nothing that suggests a 10 million dollar budget per episode. Some parts of the plot from the video game were removed (assuming to simplify the story) what made it unclear who is fighting who in the anarchy post apocalyptic world.

Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey are great actors but very bad picks for this show. Their chemistry seems forced. Their lacking to show emotions (I'm assuming since it's intentional) makes their journey and their awkward one liner exchanges a tedious experience for the viewers. The biggest question I'm asking myself when I finish watching an episode is whether I'll rewatch the show in the future. The answer is an obvious no.

Considering the art of work HBO had done throughout the years , this show is an incredible disappointment."

To me, a show that gets me and my family together and excited over watching the next episode, and then gives us reason to comment on what we saw for hours after it's done... It's simply perfect. It's what we want. That's why it gets a 10 on my book, it's everything I look for in a show.

People complain about how Ellie is unlikeable but honestly I disagree. I think that all steams from the actress physical appearance and that's honestly really sad.

All the variations and modifications here are disappointing. They didn't take the time to tell the pandemic's outbreak properly. They took all the edges of the characters away and turned them into middle class role models put in a post-apocalyptic scenario. And was it so inconceivable to let the Millers be a struggling white family? Pedro Pascal is a decent actor but he misses completley the anger and energy of Joel. That Mormont kid is just freaky and shallow compared to Ellie. And what the heck did they do to Bill? What is this? Modern Family with some bandits and infected outside the gated community? I recommend you watch a gameplay walkthrough of the PS5 Remake or the movie Children of Men for that matter. I hope you'll see the difference."

The acting is as bad as the dialouge. There are so many holes in this story and the characters actions are so improbable I can't continue watching this farce any more.

The show/game rips off the book/movie ""the Girl with all the Gifts"" which is a much better telling of a an Apocalyptic Cordyceps infestation and doesn't go out of its way to check boxes and pander to all groups."

Episode 2 was pretty good, but forgettable. I was a little disappointed as the story didn't progress much. But now we're starting to explore life beyond the quarantine zone. There's hope.

Not sure where Episode 3 came from. Talk about left field. Pretty much a waste of time spent on this romance drama. But I noticed something, the zombies disappeared. With enough hurricane fence, barbed wire, and homemade land mines, you can indefinitely hold off raiders and monsters. Who knew. OK, a dud. Nothing to see here. Moving on.

By Episode 4, we learn that 20 year old gas still works, though a little thin, 20 year old canned goods are perfectly fine to eat, zombie don't live in rural areas anymore and zombie don't occupy the same urban zones that pirates do. Where do they live, apparently just around quarantine zones? They're not in Episode 4 either. E4 is just Water World on land. On boy. Nothing new here, just urban Pirates vs Elliot and a 14 year old. But in E4, Elliot laughs. Only took 4 hours for this tiny bit of character development. The pirates are really menacing though and well fed. But no match for Elliot's deer rifle. Why did Elliot drop the M4 and keep the hunting rifle? A mystery.

The show I learned is based off of a video game. Now it makes perfect sense. Just a two-for-one corporate money making scheme - new video game sales plus TV show revenue. I get it now. Now just get Mt. Dew onboard and it's a no-brainer.

Finally just gave up halfway through E5. Just a soap opera."

Most of the shows scenes are taken from the games filler interactive gaming scenes, where you as a player have to explore survive for moving between the games magnificent cutscenes. These cutscenes are what makes this game so special, and which should have been the TV-shows real focus, but aren't.

Instead it seems the show writers are more focused on the possibility to drag the show out as long as possible by focusing on the in-between and until now almost solely focus the show on game fillers. There is a little storytelling in every episode, and just the 3'rd episode tries to expand on one of the games stories, in an surprisingly sensitive, well written and well played way.

The two main characters are badly casted, especially Ellie which totally misses the mark of the games portrait of a young girl trying to figure out her place in the world, and this role she unwillingly has been thrown into, based on her genes.

But seriously, if you really want to experience this fantastic story of The Last of Us, play the game yourself, or at least watch one of the many gameplays of the game instead, you will thank me..."

It's just not good enough.

Though there are massive shoes to fill, I cannot understand how cut scenes from the game have better acting and script than this show, whose action sequences are bereft of intensity or peril.

Pedro Pascal does his best but Bella Ramsey is poorly cast, coming across as more petty and antagonistic than childlike and tough.

I'm aware that there has to be a difference between role playing as a character and being an observer, but the show feels like a careless remake, botching every emotional high point with poor edits and choices. I was excited for Mazin's 'Chernobyl' realism, but it looks like that standard will not be met.

I haven't played the video game but if a series is based on a video game or book I probably think the books and game is better just like the Witcher or Tombraider.

Now why do they have to associate a strong woman as an unsffurable one like Ellie and make the Joel a pushover. Example of a likeable strong woman Laura Croft, Ripley and Sarah Connor.

Also what is it with episode 3, why they have to include a gay couple just for the sake and they have no relevance to the plot?"

I tried watching this after rave reviews, but the pacing was unbearable.

While there are things to praise, particularly the production values and shot framing, as well as some of the acting, at its core this is nothing new.

The zombie apocalypse has been done over and over, and having it caused by a fungus instead of a virus is not the clever twist the writers want it to be. Especially since that's not how a cordyceps works. It's like someone watched that Planet Earth documentary snipped on youtube and thought ""that's a cool idea for a horror franchise"". It may work for a video game, but it's still stupid.

The core plot of the grizzled guy adopting an immune girl and protecting her as they traverse the wasteland is decent, but not really creative either.

There's nothing here that hasn't been done better in films that came before like Dawn of the Dead.

The acting is hit and miss. Pedro Pascal is servicable, but overall forgettable. No comparison to the game's original.

I would recommend sticking to the game."

I'm amazed that the ""zombie"" genre can still attract a major audience. Since TWD debuted in 2010, there have been more than 15 zombie movies and series.

In shows like these, quality is everything. Here the acting, production values and most of the writing is pretty good. I've never played the game so I'm rating it purely on its own merits.

I think the big challenges for the series will be to keep the pacing brisk and stories moving forward (both of which plagued TWD as it aged). Are they ever going to reach their destination? Is it going to be what they were hoping? Will we ever see humanity being ""saved""? Will they move around the timeline or ""Last Of Us"" universe or game versions? Who knows what's planned but hopefully they'll see the challenges of TWD and do something different.

Permalink";"So unlike a lot of people I wanted to get a few episodes in, before making any reckless and inaccurate evaluation of this show. And it's a good thing that I always follow that rule when it comes to shows.

The Last of Us tricks you in the first episode as something that will have story quality, consistency, and smarts. But as you move from one episode to the other, you start to realize what kind of a show you really have on your hands.

The Last of Us is failing on several fronts and it's only four episodes in.

Joel although played by Pedro Pascal who I don't like at all as an actor, he's been doing the best of what he's allowed to do. You won't get the Joel of the first TLOU game, but the one from the second game. This Joel although a former soldier, he handles guns with the skill of someone that just watched people using guns on TV.

This Joel lets Ellie boss him around and even control how every conversation goes. First game Joel was a hardened man that had closed his heart to feelings, and wasn't about doing reckless dumb things. Although flawed Ellie needed him, and eventually she learns from him and he learns from her. Joel even opens up and gradually lets Ellie fill that hole left by the death of his daughter.

That's what made The Last of Us special, despite the game not having anything really groundbreaking. It was the story that made the first game special.

And this TV show is already failing on almost every front. Ellie is just insufferable. Who thought that Bella Ramsey had the acting skills to be Ellie, really missed the mark by miles. Ellie is arrogant, emotionless (maybe because Bella Ramsey can't express any more than two emotions), reckless to the point she completely ignores Joel solid and wise advices, and she acts as if she doesn't really needs Joel.

If there was a time for a race swap it should've been in this show. Bella Ramsey should've been Sarah and Nico Parker should've been Ellie. Seeing Parker at least showed great father daughter chemistry with Pascal, and they seemed to click better in the kind of relationship that Joel and Ellie need to develop.

Visually its clear that The Last of Us spared no expenses to show that world as it should he showed. But that's about the only good thing the show really has.

Joel is almost devoid of an actual personality. While Ellie is so irritating in contrast to game Ellie, that just hearing what she says and seeing what she does, is enough to wear down the patience of any reasonable person.

In an actual post apocalyptic world this Ellie would've been killed by now, while Joel would've just moved on to do something with someone else bossing him around.

The second game was a disaster of a story and character development, and this show is obviously following that path.

This show will never be what The Walking Dead was. So if you're wanting for that to happen, save yourself a lot of time and move on to another show.

The Last of Us is a sinking ship, and with each episode it just sinks deeper and deeper."

It took a lot of will power to start since I wasn't convinced the show could even do any justice to the gaming franchise. I was completely wrong! The show is a masterpiece and embodies everything that the game was for me as a kid. I'm impressed by what they have done with the special effects, cinematography, and dialogue.

The storyline is basically taken from a slew of similar movies/ series. Humor is well used, which is a refreshing spin on this formula. The script is awful and incredibly shallow. Characters make one-brain-cell decisions with a regularity that ensures they'll meet with plenty of adversity. The back stories behind each character are a thin veneer that lack depth and creativity. The action scenes are exciting and well done. Episode 3 is interesting and my favorite so far, I just wish it was more than one episode. I could spend a whole series seeing how those guys survived the adversity they probably faced. However we're just given a few scenes with their would be attackers.

I didn't even want to watch this show at first, but because of rave reviews I thought I'd give it a chance. I haven't played the video game, nor do I intend to. I don't know if they'll be able to hold up the quality for all of the episodes, but, so far, it has impressed me and kept my interest. I'm glad I decided to give it a chance because so far, it's excellent."

Permalink";"Gamers that finally have a decent show about their favorite game come in hordes to mislead the ratings on this show. Don't get me wrong this is a good tv show , bench worthy but at the current standing or 9,4 overall it's way too hyped and over rated.

Acting is of a decent standard but I've seen much better.

Music is kind of lame , they should have hired the original composer. His guitar work is absolutely stellar and the current score is just a cheap knock off and attempt to capture the original unique sound of ""the Last of Us"" game

To summarize; good show and beautifully crafted scenes (8/10) Story line and acting (6/10) = overall 7 stars from me."

Hopefully enough people will stop watching this on episode 3 so that they get the drift. Not much more I can say other than it's not well written and the fillers are boring and worthless. The zombie characters are just Wierd and not believable and they don't do a good job in explaining how and why things happened the way they did. I do recommend watching Megan that is a good movie if you are struggling to find something good to watch these days."

I am really enjoying this show very much. The story line is different from your normal ""zombie"" stuff that was so badly done with the Walking dead. But this show is unique and has a believable cause.

I have really enjoyed the acting in this show it is top notch! Pedro and Bella have done an excellent job! Supporting actors have been great as well I absolutely loved Bill and Frank and of course Tess.

But I think this show is a bit over rated. I don't see it as the best show ever as some have proclaimed. Too many excellent shows out there to claim that fact many of which are better than this one. Now if you want to say this is the best show on TV now well I can get on board with that statement easily.

HBO you have once again done an excellent job!"

Permalink";"The original Last of Us game is probably one of the best, most human stories ever told in video game medium and in storytelling in general. This show is a mix of good parts from the video game (those are all the best parts that people keep raving about) and bad parts that were all added by the writers of the show so the show would be 'modernized'.

So there are two possibilities - if they remain faithful of the game you'll get a good show (or rather 1 season of a good show since the sequel to the game was dreadful), if they deviate too much it's going to be bad.

Judging by the first 3 episodes they will use the good parts from the game to keep the people engaged while inserting every few episodes their new and lame ideas that will impose their ultramoralist 'message' on the 'morally incorrect' world.

For reference the first episode was a mix of stuff from the game and new ideas, the second was almost shot for shot taken from the game, the third was all new content that changed the two side-characters and made them ultra-idyllic and likeable, hence ruining the subtle complexity they used to have in the game."

Permalink";"May be it is because of the 10 out of 10 opening episode that I feel a little disappointed after 4 episodes now. And it is not because of episode 3 because I actually liked that episode, but it was to soon for a background story imo. And now episode 4 also didn't pick up the pace. To be honest it is getting boring...

I still have high hopes because they showed how good it can be in the first and partly the second episode.

I still like the world building and the relationship build up between the lead characters. But where the first 3 episodes demanded my attention, they lost me in the 4th episode.

For me it is going a point down each episode so I am now at a 7 out of 10. Let's hope it will climb up again to the excellent start and will end somewhere between an 8 and a 9.

Update: after episode 6 for me it is back to an 8. It is a different serie then I expected but somehow it gets me emotionally. Great acting and the story is really about the relationship between the two leads. Can't wait for the rest of the season!

Episode 7, another letdown, long and boring with nothing really happening... back to 7 out of 10

Episode 8, better but gona leave my score at 7 till I have seen the season final.

After episode 9 still a 7 out of 10. Not going into spoilers. Just want to say this could have been one of the better shows but a couple of episodes bring it down and allthough they do make it up with a couple of really good episodes it doesn't really recover.

Still worth the watch and it is a good show, but it could have been great. If I was to rewatch it I would skip ep 4, 5 and 7 (may be 3 depending on my mood) and will love it!

Looking forward to season 2."

There are some differences but overall they work and there is no major deviation that changes the course of the story. I thoroughly enjoy it. At first, I was worried about the casting but the actors are portraying their characters well. They have gotten better throughout the series in my opinion. Go into this show knowing that everything is morally gray. In fact, morals lean more on the bad side. There are no heroes and right vs wrong depends on your perspective as a viewer. It is a dark and unfortunately conceivable look into human nature when society collapses."

The infection and disease is basically straight from the games, the only changes made to the source material tend to revolve around characters and some parts of setting. The changes are minor enough so as to not interfere with the plot or original content, but actually help tell the story outside of interactive media. Studios have struggled with turning video games into TV and movies because of the interactive element. Making it a character drama and telling stories about the characters makes this show as great as it is. That's all."

Same formulae as other like Walking dead but no real strong plot.

I don't understand all the superlative 10/10 reviews I am seeing for this show. To me it felt like just another apocalyptic end of the world zombies show.

I have never played the video game related to this. But Perhaps lot of the people who are writing these 10 /10 ratings are comparing with the video game. But it is crazy that they decided it was excellent after watching the first episode.

The show is based the premise that everyone in the world is infected with some fungal infection which turns them into zombies. The survivors are dealing with the aftermath. The story picks up 20 years after the apocalypse.

I thought Pedro Pascal was good in the show. Otherwise rest of the cast including Bella Ramsey as Ellie was very annoying and not worth the trouble watching.

If you want to watch just another zombie show then go for it, otherwise you can skip it."

She gives one of the most convincing performances I can recall seeing in a person under 20, or really by any person of any age. She hits every emotional note and by midway through season 1 it is clear we are witnessing a star making performance. I can't wait to see what this young person does in the future. She is going to be one of the brightest lights in Hollywood for a long time if she maintains anything close to the level of excellence she displays in this series. One might not think a zombie apocalypse could provide a backdrop for one of the strongest performances of this century and one would be wrong."

To my surprise episode one was very good and if I had to rate that episode it would be an eight. The second episode was a little disappointing and shifted in time, having lost a liked character as well, leaving a rating of 6 in my books. The third episode was about other characters, which I disliked intensively and was most annoying to watch. This had absolutely nothing to do with the story and earns my disapproval rating of one. So for the 3 episodes so far seen, it boils down to an average series with a rating of five stars. I await episode 4 to make up my mind to continue watching or scrapping the lot."

This episode was a work of art, and if you stay on after the credits roll you will get a deeper dive as to what this gem is all about. There was also a slight change (actually a big one) from the game, which the producer speaks of in this break down of the episode.

I personally, had never even heard of the game, but am interested in checking it out, if my son, (the gamer), is so inclined to purchase.

This series really has a different take on the Zombie genre, in a good way. So go at it with an open-mind rather than trying to figure out the producers hidden meaning. Just enjoy it, will ya."

I was not familiar with the game so I had no idea what the zombie would look like and how they function, but I'm impressed they are fast and scary, and the fungus that connects everything makes them scarier.

The story is well written and it sure doesn't fail to deliver emotions.

I hope it doesn't go in the same direction as the walking dead and becomes like a soap opera with lame characters and stupid storylines.

So far so good, worth the watch."

Permalink";"Below is my original review I made after watching first three episodes. I must say i jumped the gun, as the show progressively got much better. By the end of it I was really hooked to the show and the main characters. I am also impressed how they kept it close to the source material. Overall, I can't wait for the second season, and I am changing my rating to 10 stars.

""I'm a big gamer and I appreciate game adaptations. Good news is that Uwe Boll stayed away from this one.

Watching first 3 episodes gives me a feeling of a solid show that will bring to life another successful franchise made by HBO.

However...the casting and rewriting? Original game characters were more convincing and relatable. For example in the show Ellie is just a super annoying kid, that will outsmart everyone in every situation, with arrogance of Simon Cowell. The game portraits this character as a vulnerable kid that is struggling to adopt to the new reality. The HBO's Ellie is just annoying and unlikable. The cast does not help either, as one-dimensional young actor seems not to be able to pull the weight.

Still a good show so far and I'll definitely stick to it unless it de-rails significantly from the source material.

P. S. Why all these 10 star praises by paid raters...we all know by now that 99% of comments on high budget products is paid by marketing agencies, so it's getting a bit old and annoying seeing this high reviews. I actually think it's counter productive as it makes regular viewers annoyed."""

The show is decent with great special effects, and follows the game fairly well, but there are some serious flaws. First of all it is a mix of good and bad actors and I mean that literally. After watching the first 3 episode it feels as if HBO spent most of thier casting budget on a few actors and then wrangled up a bunch D listers to fill in the rest. Secondly they took a critically acclaimed video game and changed most of the main characters so that the could check off thier equity boxes and add all of episode 3,that was total trash and did nothing for the story just add some tacky unnecessary wokness to check off a few more boxes. Once again it damages a already awsome story for no reason, if it isn't broken don't fix it. Last but not least the girl who plays Ellie is so far from the game character it's not even funny. When you combine the bad casting with her over acting it make her scenes almost unwatchable."

Whilst albeit a fan of Offerman I didn't even realise he'd show up in this.

Having played TLOU on ps3/ps4 and now ps5 I can't begin to understand how viewers (and especially gamers) have even begun to disrespect this episode.

I'm a straight male father (that admittedly grew up around musical theatre folk and performing arts in general) so perhaps I have a viewpoint that is (like every viewpoint I guess) conditioned.

I will simply state that for me this is the best episode of a tv show I have ever seen at my mediocre near 40 years on this planet. The love shown between Frank & Bill is simply incredible...

I cried multiple times during this and I have no shame in admitting that.

The fact Mr Offerman and Mr Bartlett were able to induce this reaction from me is stunning.

Well played gents and to anyone that is wanting to watch what is in my opinion the best episode of a tv show ever crafted. Please enjoy."

The scenery and storylines are very reminiscent of (Vanessa) Van Helsing but definitely not in the same league. It lacks pace, suspense and just isn't scary and doesn't keep me gripped and wanting more.

Nothing feels new to what we have seen before, apart from the fungal parasite, and the pandemic infection has a very weird incubation rate depending on where you are infected.

Like so many people who have watched The Last of Us, he was so touched by Bill and Frank's story. It was personal for him because he is gay, but he was right that this episode is as it's been reported. It is a great standalone episode. It doesn't matter whether you're gay or straight, old or young. It's worth watching to experience another view of love and its purpose.

The writing is superb. I was not surprised that Craig Mazin wrote it. I thought his writing for Chornobyl was excellent. I was shocked but not surprised that Frank was played by Murray Bartlett (Armond in The White Lotus). I thought, ""who is this actor? He's incredible."" He and Nick Offerman were magical. It was such a beautiful but heart-wrenching ballad. I couldn't help but cry for the 15 minutes. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."

How is this? Because the show is based on a stupid video game and not science.

Regardless, you are in for an amazing ride that doesn't over use zombies in this case ""clickers"" to constantly move the story like so many other do when the plot gets weak.

From thr first few minutes in episode one you realize the stakes are high and the characters are living in a nightmare. What made me write this review was episode three. It was one of the most moving episodes of television I have ever seen. One, I couldn't get out of my head the next day.

A truly moving love story wedged into an apocalyptic world. You don't need to like games, zombie flicks or distopian, bleak worlds to enjoy episode 3 and realize it is tory telling at its best.

That is not to say the rest of the series doesn't deliver, it is a phenomenal show even without episode 3. Pedro Pascal and his costars Anna Torv and Bella Ramsey are perfectly cast and flesh out what are great characters to begin with.

However this series rises above that and is worthy of great reviews now . I've just watched episode 3 and there's no way to describe it other than absolutely superb . I thoroughly enjoyed ep 1 & 2 but 3 is another level. No spoilers so some vagueness lol. The scene has been set in 1 & 2 with 3 moving onto how it affects people in a subtle and uncliched manner , some series try that but shift back towards the core horror to keep things moving. Ep 3 doesn't do that and doesn't need to . It's a several year snapshot of just how people react but the horror is still lurking at the gate , not overwhelming but lurking and affecting how they make good with things. It's also an excellent study in human behaviour well written , well cast and superbly played . The actual subject matter becomes partly irrelevant as you root for and feel for the 2 main characters . Their life isn't perfect , ups and downs , but they pull through until the tearjerker ending ."

Permalink";"The amount of reviews here saying ""it's the best thing I've ever seen"" is absolutely hilarious and after the pilot episode everyone decided it was worthy of a 10/10 rating, which it is definately not. Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with it as such, other than Ellie being probably one of the most irritating child characters ive seen, but there is nothing at all about the first 3 episodes that particularly stands out. Everything I've seen so far is just average and generic for this type of plot. We've seen it all before, which I have nothing against, but it is no where near as good as people are making out.

I don't even understand what the point of episode 3 was. A full episode about a gay couple who had almost nothing to do with the main story itself, other than the fact they had a weapon stash. It was a completely unnecessary episode in my opinion.

Apart from that I don't really have any complaints, but certainly nothing worthy of praising either. 6/10."

I've cried every episode, and in the third episode, I downright broke down because of the sheer devotion and care being displayed on the screen. It's not often that you see healthy relationships portrayed on screen-and even less often that you see them in a post-apocalyptic landscape. I think that this episode will live in my mind for a long, long time.

Beautiful performances and storytelling that complements the video game so well. Every casting choice has been phenomenal and elevating. Couldn't recommend this series enough.

I literally created this IMDB account just to post this review. It's that good."

I've been thrilled and excited and even episode 3 which did go on a bit longer than I hoped was such a beautiful story that it deserves its own episode. I am excited to see what the future of the series becomes. So far all the actors have done some of their best works to date. It's definately worth giving it a shot."

Remaining faithful to source material, reutizilizing lines/quotes as appropriate, incorporating the already masterpiece original game soundtrack, and any changes made have served to better work for the live action medium, whilst remaining true to its source.

Permalink";"The producers, directors, cast and staff for this production have had to take on of the most acclaimed video games and transpose it to a different medium.

They have also had to please the game's avid fan base while at the same time creating a new experience for non-gamers.

In just the first two episodes of this first season, they have succeeded in providing the background (with some of the most creative use of cold openings) and at the same time introducing and realizing key cast members and their motivations.

The third episode, for all its controversy, does not introduce new concept from the game but the producers have taken the liberty of building on to the story of two key supporting characters in a way that drives home the narrative of the game and also the show.

Haters are gonna hate, but it doesn't detract from the quality of this program. I'm happy to hear a second season is already green lighted!"

The show is actually better than expected and feels at least marginally plausible (minus the 10 miles from Boston shot, of course--that kind of thing is the reason for 9/10 and not 10/10).

I'm glad I gave it a chance. I recalled seeing my kids play some of the game, and noticed that the ""Chernobyl"" people were behind this production, so I had to watch. The actors do an excellent job with the material and even go in some new and unexpected directions that decidedly improve upon the genre while adding some depth to the world they are building.

Anyway, if you are on the fence about watching, definitely give it a chance! It's likely you will be pleasantly surprised."

Its seems HBO and Sony entertainment put some real thought and emotions into the adaptation of 'The last of us' and some real messages even though were only three episodes in.

I loved all three of the episodes but the third has really stood out for me. Bill and nick really touched me, and even though it's the lowest rated episode so far I personally, loved it. They didn't go over the top and I was glad Joel didn't get into the bedroom. (Didn't want to see that honestly)

Looking forward to the rest of the season, even if the episodes don't follow Joel and ellie directly I'm loving it. Well done to all."

To find something so beautiful, positive and strong in the midst of so much horror was amazing. Then have it played out so perfectly to it's untimely end. Cannot praise this high enough. The writing, the acting, the direction... I'm told it plays out differently in the game, which made the episode even better in my opinion.

Sometimes these shows can turn into gratuitous shooting fests but The Last of Us is so refreshingly human centred so far. Looking forward to seeing what comes next!"

I can hear some of the ""snowflakes"" out there will review bomb this wonderful episode for having the ""wrong kind of characters"" living and surviving when others died but let them stay in their own ugly lives and leave us our favorite characters show us that life and love can be found in the most horrific of events.

Permalink";"We are only three episodes in so this review is incomplete by default, but their track record has been impeccable and portends great things for the rest of the season.

For the record, I gave it 9/10 only because I think the bar for a perfect anything should be exceptionally high. But, I really wanted to give it that extra star.

Anyway, I'm in love with everything in this show. It's grim by nature, but doesn't revel in it. There are plenty of dark/brooding shows happy to tell a story through how bad they make you feel and how much comfort they can deny you, but for all it's apocalypsing The Last Of Us escapes this trap. There are absolutely dark and awful events, but I'm continually brought back by the strength of its flawed but wildly relatable characters. It also helps that despite the end of civilization, the world of TLOU with its nature reclaimed cities is quite naturally beautiful to look at!

There is also a subtly in TLOU that never feels like filler. There are lines that are absolutely needed for exposition, but through the exceptional writing/directing/acting they feel so natural that often I either I'm so invested in the scene and characters that I don't notice, or the delivery is so good that I'd be happy with more. This is absolutely an area that can and does drive me crazy in many other shows, so it feels special that these stumbles in TLOU are so far so rare. Not limited to dialogue, the appropriate use of time is extended to travel as well, and it's a test image to the directors confidence in their ability to tell a story that they know how to do such an exceptional job while respecting the viewers time and attentions.

And now seems like a good time to cut this review short, so I'll just include the remaining bullet points where I think TLOU stands out from other shows."

Really was afraid that unprofessional aproach seen in many projects will ruin it, yes Im refering to director loby hes exposed to and after it influenced choice of one actor it now changed a whole episode. It felt great, as the cast is up until this point but Im afraid it will slip in some of the future episode and ruin it all.

Recomendation until now and I hope they will stick to original story and end it as it should be, as it is in game.

Not sure how it will follow the game in distant future if we come up to that point but certainly new sequels can be made or tv show can continue its own path, but following the game up to the point it can be followed is crucial imo."

I thourouhly enjoyed the first two episodes of this post apocalyptic zombie drama very much. The opening two episodes were fantastic. Accurately following the game and setting the dynamics of Ellie and Joels relationship excellently. The third episode was very much a filler episode in my opinion. Though the story was compelling it could have easily been told in half an episode and left the other half of the episode to let us enjoy some zombie mayhem. Some reviewers have given this episode one star only I believe that is harsh. I hope future episodes contain less filler content and more apocalyptic action."

Like many others, I was skeptical. Each episode so far, leaves the viewer hanging, but with resolve. I'm not giving anything away as far as what the episodes entail, but I will say there are a few that really tackle the humanistic side of living in America in past, present and the future. There's something for everyone.

The action is epic. The acting is top-notch, and the characters pull you in to the point where you can't wait to see what the turn-out will be in the long run.

Although we've only gotten this far, episode three blew me away and I truly see upcoming award nominations for that episode.

Finally, a sci-fi show with some context and meat that stimulates the viewership and brings them to a whole new level. Bravo!!!!"

And now in episode 3 they need to become politically correct. I hate this. It's totally unnecessary.

I'll keep watching the series, and hope that it is going to get better. However, I am afraid that at the end I will be extremely disappointed.

First epi was good, as I've never played the game, it was actually very nice introduction on how the thing's gets worse.

Second epi was 2nd best so far, moving story, great direction, everything was perfect.

Third epi on one side, is mine personal fvrt so far, this is non spoiler so I'm not gonna say much, but if you've seent the epi, you know why my eyes where full of tears.

I think the most best part of the series is it's atmosphere, it is very atmospheric show, rather being a apocalyptic story, we somehow connected so it hardly, that's why Hats off to all the crews of tlou, direction to set design to cinematography to bgm, everything is top top notch, as far as acting is concern, pedro has yet again prove that he's special, he really need a big big-screen project, bella ramsay has surprised us with her talent, she's just brilliant in her role, nick offerman, murray Barrett have done Oscar level acting in epi 3, I really am shortened by word to praise there hard work.

My final verdict will be, that, it is a big project, it is not going to stop recently, it will break many records, and I'm suspecting it to end in my top3 series of all time, when it ended.

Some even says that this is the best ever adaptation of any game in the history of universe.

So if you're wondering should I watch it or not, stop reading more reviews, just go and watch the freaking show, your brother has given word, ""you will not be disappointed""."

The first episode starts out normal enough but how it progresses and ultimately sets Joel up on his trajectory is heart wrenching and excellently crafted.

The characters are developed naturally but the show doesn't get bogged down with pointless dialogue or trying to do more than propel it's story forward while slowly expanding the world Joel and Ellie exist in. With only three episodes in it's hard to say how great this will be, but so far The Last of Us is one of the best new shows out there."

Permalink";"I will be purposefully vague.

The game, first did NOT play the second, was ok. Joel had a soothing voice and everything else was simple grind.

I originally intended to NOT watch the series.

But I have grown somewhat fond of Pascal. He is very similar to Nathan Fillion in LOU. Sounds like, looks like. And even moves like him.

Actually if they make a new version of Firefly he could play his son. Thus allowing two generations on screen at once, if Fillion chose to guest star.

Ellie really grew on me. Dry Brit wit, slightly Asperger look and seemingly fine acting ability. Then again what else would be expected of a Brit actress?

And she swears like a sailor.

Obviously the writers did not think through the noise factor. Everyone seems to have attached junk that would clink making sounds which the beasts may hear.

Everything was tooling along smoothly though a bit slowly until episode 3.

Sadly the game character arc of the two characters in that episode was way more involving than in the series. I know they were tossed in to placate the audience,In the game the reveal was at the END of the activities reading a note. That minuscule aspect won the game an award and accolades.

Ep3 was a waste of characters. Taking a fully fleshed out game character, having Joel warn Ellie about him, then NEVER meeting him. Simple throw aways.

And dumb at that.

One scene where the well seasoned character stands in the middle of the road, everything blazing with fire, and using his scoped hunting riffle fires out into the attackers.

Duh, well lit, scoped rifle, hide behind something and zero in then move to the next cover.

Every ten year old who has played a first person shooter understands that.

Even the worst episodes of walking Dead were better planned and executed than this. Truly this could have been slipped into TWD reruns and no one would be able to tell the difference. You know the early weepy seasons, maybe after meeting Herschel.

If the creators intent is to simply copy instead of ADAPT the game then we get a single season.

Ellie gets two stars, pascal gets two stars, Torv gets honorable mention.

This is not the show I eagerly await all week long.

That would be Doom patrol. Or maybe even Fringe reruns.

See how I worked Torv in there."

I wasn't excited to hear that the show made some changes compared to the games. So far it seems that these changes do work better for the show, which is great.

I wish that the future episodes of this show don't dissappoint but it is surely quite difficult to keep this level of quality during the show. Maybe the limited runway (based only on 2 games) will help on that."

Permalink";"I can't say that the show is bad in general. But it is far from living up to its potential. And episode 3 has show us that it can really suck (no pun intended) at times.

I am going to loosely address some reasons for why I think this show is disappointing and not as good as it could be:

Bad casting of main characters, unnecessary type-switching.


Though I think that most of the actors are good, a lot of them and especially the main characters are not matching their counterparts from the game and the game (at least TLOU, Part I) just nailed it. The actors are good, but the casting choices still are just bad.



There is no matching chemistry between the actors of Joel & Tess or Joel & Ellie.



Those deviations don't add anything good to the story, they are just annoying distraction at best and derailment at worst.



There is more examples than just the bigger part of episode 3 for that.



When it sticks to the main plot, it's not bad. But it's not really good either.

After episode 3 I decided to take a break from watching the show and before I would continue to watch, I will wait till the whole season has aired and the reviews came in. If according to the non-shill and non-cheerleader reviews the show will give us more crap in the direction of episode 3, I'm out for good."

Permalink";"I wish I could tell you the specifics of how this show has failed, but I am not allowed to broach those topics on this website. So instead of the now redacted 350 word critique I published about the content of the first 3 episodes, I am forced to only address the ""PG-rated"" elements of this series, in bullet-point fashion.

-Bill was a different character in the games. Changing him was a mistake

-Ellie had a different personality in the games. Changing her was a mistake.

-Joel is cast perfectly, and is the sole acting talent lending any credibility.

-Episode 3 was 45 minutes of backstory for non-cannon characters that did not shape the story of the main characters at all. If you fell asleep for 45 minutes of that episode, not only would you miss noting about the characters, but it would not even break narrative continuity.

I urge you all to watch the 2013 ""cut scene movie"" of The Last of Us, available free on youtube. It stands the test of time, and shows what this series could have been."

Permalink";"As someone who had never played (or heard of) the game, I started watching because it had a lot of promotion and two fabulous actors from one of my all-time favorite shows, Game of Thrones. I found Episode 1 pretty mediocre and would have rated it a ""6"". But, I will always give a series at least two episodes to win me over. After Episode 2 I would have stopped altogether if not for my husband asking me to stick with it for one more episode. My problem with the first two episodes was that I genuinely didn't care about the lead characters at all; Joel and Ellie were (are) so unlikeable that I just didn't care if they survived or not. For me, I've got to care about SOMEONE to stick with a show; Episode 3 introduced two new beautiful, wonderful, nuanced characters named Bill and Frank that captured my heart and won me over. I cared about them and, for me, it was a truly great episode and the reason for my ""10"" rating. Now, I accept that I'm much older than the demographic this series is targeting, but there are millions of people like me out there (50+) so I hope there's more of what this last episode delivered down the road, and that Joel and Ellie begin to thaw a bit so I can feel invested in their journey and survival."

Cut to the show coming out. I wasn't sure I'd like it because I expected more misery porn, but my wife wanted to see it, so I joined her. Episodes 1 and 2 are pretty good, but episode three shocked me with how good it was. It's a beautiful depiction of love in a time of savagery and government repression. I don't know if the rest of the show will turn out to be terrible, but this episode will always be one of the best I've ever seen, of any show, ever. If you never watch another episode of the show watch this one."

Close to the video game, but taking well thought liberties, the last of us is evenly balanced with emotions, laughs, tensions, fear and suspense. It's incredible how the rythm of the show is so well-rounded.

At first I was afraid, because the video game was so good and I thought, well another zombie series. But it's not. It's way more. Everyone could and should watch it even those scared of horror or zombies. It's not about that and those scenes are closer to tension and survival than fear and weird stuff as it could be in other shows.

Congrats to hbo who once again has shown a masterclass on how series should be crafted."

They will encounter good people, bad people and of course then never ending supply of infected monsters. They will build friendships and lose loved ones. Eventually their destination will be completed when they dave the world. I would prefer to see a series on the evils of Big Pharma. But instead we have a series based on a similar formula to the walking dead and shows in this genre. After 3 episodes I have already lost interest. I fast forwarded through the last episode."

I was unfamiliar with the game but I was a huge TWD fan (up to season 8) and hoped that there finally was another worthy Zombie series. I managed to get through 3/4 of the first episode and wondered why so many people rated the pilot so highly?

TLOU currently rates higher than GOT, TWD & BB to name a few of the major series of the past.

I can only assume that most of the 10s and 9s come from gamers who played the game.

If you enjoyed the before mentioned shows do not bother with this one. At times it feels like watching a game and..... I'm sorry to say, for avid TV watchers, this show is way overrated."

But that's not my problem with it. The plot is thin, the acting a bit wooden and not entertaining or intriguing. It needs to be one of the two.

Maybe I missed the point but the opening scenes/episode didn't seem to tie up with the next episode. There has to be a hook that pulls you in and makes you want to watch more or a character that you root for. For me it had none of those things.

I don't think I'll bother to persevere with it. For those that love it, good luck to you."

You go ahead but after three and the third being not what I want in this sort of show, I'm going to watch what the reviews are and It's not good so far. Once they run out of ""stick to the storyline"" screenplay, this thing is probably going to fall apart.

The sets are nice the story slightly plausible, the lead is good. Pablo is like a Nathan Fillion knockoff, if not that a worthy successor. They could (didn't say should) do a new Firefly reboot with him.

Oh the kid - yeah, I think in the story she's supposed to be endearing but I didn't get that here."

The recent third episode especially has taken a section from the game and completely created a different wave of emotions that the characters have brought that I didn't feel initially.

Having episodes that have nothing to do with the main characters is what modern shows have been missing recently, it was brilliant to have a filler episode of characters that weren't fully developed in the game. It really humanizes the situation and world we are being put in.

I can't wait to see what else they will bring into the show."

It really ticked me off because it was such a waste of time - Elle tells Joel how she got bit in about 30 seconds in episode 8. I have read that several here did not care for the ending. I liked it. What I now realize is this show is more of a drama than The Walking Dead which relied heavily on zombie attacks to provide the drama. Zombies are part of this show but it focus's much more on human survival and how the human race is as bad or worse than zombies. Some didn't like how this show negatively portrays Christianity but I disagree - he was a false prophet which Jesus warned us about. Yes, there are parts that are far fetched, very far fetched, but did you expect anything different? What I didn't like was the filler episodes and I did not much care for the girl who plays Elle. Just not a good fit. In addition, Joel meeting up with his brother was the original mission. He gets there and they hug ... and that's about it. So Joel and Elle move on. Disappointing. Overall its good but could have been great."

In this particular series they did so good work carefully and respectfully with everything to be close to the game and u get so much feelings which is the main thing to me. Of course they will make extra scenes, dialogue etc, I didn't want to see the exactly same thing as the game. (This is especially for the kiss and 3rd episode)

In my opinion listen to noone, bad or good critics and watch it and do the same with every other series you think it's good. Don't let others change your point of view.

Permalink";"The ""Last of Us"" TV show, based on the popular video game of the same name, has been one of the most highly anticipated adaptations in recent memory. The show, produced by HBO and developed by Craig Mazin, follows the journey of Joel and Ellie, two survivors in a world ravaged by a fungal pandemic, as they make their way across the country to deliver Ellie to the Fireflies, a resistance group.

One of the standout elements of the show is its writing. Craig Mazin, who previously created the critically acclaimed ""Chernobyl"" miniseries, has brought a level of nuance and depth to the world and characters of ""The Last of Us."" The show expands on the themes of the game, such as the bonds of family and the desperation of survival, and explores the characters in a way that was not possible in the limited form of the game. The writing also does a great job of fleshing out the world and the events that led to the outbreak, providing a rich and immersive backdrop for the main story.

Another strength of the show is the performances of the cast. Pedro Pascal, who plays Joel, brings a level of gravitas and emotion to the role that captures the spirit of the character from the game. Bella Ramsey, who plays Ellie, is a revelation, bringing a level of vulnerability and strength to the character that is truly captivating. The supporting cast is equally impressive, with standout performances from Gabriel Luna, Emily Swallow, and Dylan Minnette.

The show's production values are also top-notch, with HBO's signature attention to detail and quality on full display. The cinematography is beautiful, capturing the desolate beauty of the post-apocalyptic world, and the special effects are top-notch, bringing the infected to life in a way that is both frightening and awe-inspiring. The score, composed by Gustavo Santaolalla, is hauntingly beautiful, perfectly capturing the mood and atmosphere of the show.

Overall, the ""Last of Us"" TV show is a triumph. It manages to capture the essence of the game while expanding on it in meaningful and impactful ways. The writing, performances, and production values all come together to create a truly immersive and emotional experience that is a must-watch for fans of the game and newcomers alike. Whether you're a fan of the game or not, the ""Last of Us"" TV show is a tour de force that should not be missed."

And who would have thought such a touching and emotional story would be found in the middle of a series based on a video game with zombies (which does not do this show justice)? But here it is and we're lucky to have it. We need more. Compelling performances from Offerman and Bartlett. Intimate moments. A story of survival and what it means to find love and protect it in a world of death, destruction and hopelessness. Ep 3 has a surprising ending that completely turned what I was seeing as sorrow, into sweetness."

Also Joel was not a pushover like he is in the show. He was tough. He wouldn't take any of her crap like they are portraying here. She completely walks all over him.

I have never been hooked on a show this early on. After episode one I quickly became obsessed with this show and trusted that I wouldn't be disappointed.

I have noticed plenty of differences between the show and the game, but I can understand why those changes were made and appreciate the differences. I know many fans of the game are upset about some differences but personally I enjoy seeing new sides to the story that we didn't get to see in the game.

I thought episode 1 was a great introduction to the world and liked how we learned a bit more information about the outbreak than was given in the game.

Episode 2 was amazing and what solidified in my mind that they made the correct choice for casting. I really do see the characters I fell in love with from the game represented in the show.

Episode 3 was possibly the best episode of a television series I have ever seen. This is probably where the show has deviated from the game the most but I am so happy they did it that way. It brought so much depth to the character learning his backstory.

Although it is different from the game, I have learned to appreciate both ways a story can be told, and I hope other fans can see that too."

They do say life mirrors what we watch and vice versa. I so hope these real life fungi don't take that leap and infect us, as we'd be knackered and life on earth would be akin to an extinction level event.

I'm really looking forward to watching the rest of the episodes. I usually look at fan pages of shows/films I'm really enjoying. I'm really enjoying not engaging with its fan base at the moment, as I don't want the next episodes ruined by the ending being discussed.

I like how the story interweaved between the initial suspicion of who might be the bad guy when they first met and then realising that there was no bad guy and it was a simple but exceptional story of two people connecting in a remarkable way.

Permalink";"I shouldn't be surprised that this show is rated so high. First, it's based on a video game by the same title. Second, is is perfectly timed to coincide with the end of The Walking Dead.

Though I've only seen the first 3 episodes, it's not very hard to guess where the series is going. Man and girl traverse zombified United States and since she is immune she is the only person who can save mankind.

In case you forgot, the comic book and TV series Y: The Last Man already covered the immunity plot, and the walking Dead literally beat to death the zombie apocalypse.

While I understand those that have played the game are naturally more inclined to like this show, for the rest of the audience it's just more of the same."

This has real moments to show the developed love story between two men that happened upon each other by chance and developed a strong caring bond. The end of the couple is truly romantic. It shows the simple caring loving portions of life over their 16 years together which is quite heartwarming.

Don't believe the one star reviews, these are people that are out to just show their hatred. This episode deserves an Emmy for Murray and Nick and I hope they at least get nominated."

I made it through to three episodes but won't be watching anymore, especially as episode three was terrible.

Good points are the acting, and thought the first episode was a decent starting point, but it soon became formulaic. I really don't care what happens to the characters going forwards, which is obviously a key consideration of whether the series will be good or not.

It's fair to say I'm not the biggest fan of zombie stories anyway, as to me they're all the same with the exception of the brilliant 28 Days Later, but even so I think this is just boring and unimaginative."

The acting is great, Pedro Pascal is perfect casting carrying over his Mandalorian energy with a Texas twist. The girl actress is great, too.

One aspect I find a bit far fetched is the use of cordycepts mushrooms as the catalyst. They simply wouldn't infect humans (check out Paul Stamet's social media post breaking down this concept) and I think the mycelium popping out of the shroom zombie mouths is a bit goofy and overly gross. But, hey, it's a zombie show. Gross is good."

One of the best episodes I've seen on television for awhile. Some of the absurdly low reviews claimed this episode was ""just a filler!"" or ""this didn't happen in the game!"" or ""not enough action and zombies - whEre R aLl the zombies???"" - for the love of god...you muppets rating this masterpiece of an episode with a pitiful 1/10 ARE THE ZOMBIES, that's where the freaking zombies are.

A video game is a video game and a television show is a television show - these are both drastically different storytelling mediums. A lot of folks are missing the point of an ADAPTATION.

The show's writers and creators have done an impeccably superb job of taking a story from one medium and turning it into this masterpiece we're seeing unfold here. Episode 3 surpasses all my expectations for what strong world building, theme building, character building should look like...we're here to explore ALL the facets of humanity including love (and what that looks like) in a dystopian wasteland - the writers are giving us the content from the video game, yes...but they're also giving us so much more.

THIS show is what television as a medium should strive for....they're doing what so few have managed to achieve.

THIS show is what storytelling is all about.

If you just want a show about ""zombies"" and ""action"" and NOTHING else (yawn)...I dunno dudes, maybe this show and its more nuanced, mature themes just isn't for you."

Permalink";"The game deserved all the rave reviews it received. It was truly compelling. Great story. Great characters. Beautiful graphics. Damn intense gameplay. The Dev Studio knocked it WAY out of the park.

Given all the excellent memories that had accrued while playing the game twice, I was looking forward to viewing this small screen adaptation. There's obviously far too much content in the game to translate to a limited-length series, but that could be a boon for the show runners as a killer subset of compelling and intense scenes/locations could be chosen to portray. Following that simple adaptation methodology, it seemed obvious to me that the series, like the game, should be an easy home run.

The first two episodes were quite promising. The casting was strong, (Bella Ramsey was a good choice for she was very solid in Game of Thrones). The sets were impressive. The cinematography and CGI were high quality. The appearance of the afflicted, especially the clickers, was well done. The overall dark and grim physical and psychological tone of the game was captured quite well. A few items were outright changed, e.g. The addition of the Borg-like (see Star Trek: Next Gen) fungi, but the producers' rationales for making said changes were understandable. I, and apparently countless other gamers, was left quite satisfied.

Then came episode three.

Sigh... So much for hitting the easy home run by selecting a killer subset of game scenes/locations to portray. It seemed so very simple and obvious. Alas, instead of simply portraying awesome scene after awesome scene from the game, all of the sudden, the series, which had been moving forward nicely, was thrown into reverse. Why was there so much time wasted on a slow and superfluous plot thread that did not take place in the kinetic and compelling plot of the game? I fear that this will not be the last tangential jaunt.

Why the screenplay writer for the series, who also happened to write the game's story, would not merely follow his own tried, tested and beloved story is befuddling."

Permalink";"This series is so basic. It great resembles Walking Dead. Dialogs are almost non existing and when they are, they are empty in content. Conection between characters? Zero, none. Spectator is lefted to ignorance as much as possible, and that is not suspense; suspense is when you know more than the characters know and you are expecting to their reaction in the scenes to what you already know as a spectator. But here you know almost nothing about the drama and much less to what the characters know. The director tries to extend as much as possible each minute, minute after minute. Even the sound recordind of voices at times is false, clearly post-recording in the studio. It's an emptiness story, or better: it's a 1 or 0 bit story, infected or not infected. That's it. Very, very doubtful how this can have a 9+ rating out a 10 or 4+ out of 5. I give this a 1 out a 5, based on the first two episodes, and it's clear we will not get any far around of this emptiness of scarring zombies."

This latest episode, episode 3, really showed what a tv show could do to give you some background on characters and take you into another realm within its boundaries. It was a smart episode and a minor callback to something that happened ""off-screen"" that cleverly provided the main characters the biggest thing they were needing.

Please continue making the next season this way, still excited for the remaining 3/4 of this season!"

Permalink";"The first two episodes were excellent in setting up the world of The Last of Us. I was skeptical about seeing Pascal in another taking care of a youngling role similar to The Mandalorian. But this is a different flavour. More grounded and realistic in its portrayal of an apocalyptic wasteland and human misery with brief moments of human decency showing its light. The use of prologues in this show is just masterful. That is one of the reasons I started watching this show. It ramps up the show and leads you smoothly into the world. I have to say there are slow moments at times in the show but there are payoffs waiting for it in the end.

Great acting performances from Pascal and Ramsey as a duo.

Nick Offerman and Murray Bartlett(White Lotus) were spectacular in their roles in my favourite episode of the show(S01E03).

This show is so good. I was pleasantly surprised by the amazing story telling based of a video game. Since, The recent video game-based projects have lost their marbles or so bland/boring that you cannot watch more than one episode."

The second episode helped clear things up. I was very impressed with the acting, sets and cinematography. Just shows that dark sets don't have to be so dark that the viewer sees nothing.

Then came episode 3, and I fell in love with the show. The side story of Bill and Frank was unexpected (to me anyway...again, knew nothing of the games) and was sublime. The actors, Nick Offerman and Murray Bartlett, were beyond good in their roles. Add to that the Linda Ronstadt sound track...perfection.

Fingers crossed that the show continues to be great!"

Bill and Frank's storyline left me with so many emotions. Seeing their story blossom so beautifully, and come full circle was very fulfilling. Their storytelling was so masterful it leaves you content yet wanting to see more of these characters.

The way their story tie into Joel, and Tess's was also very well done and now noticing the bits of foreshadowing from previous episodes.

Even having played the game, I was still completely unprepared for such a heartwrenching episode."

They also screwed up by casting the most unlikeable young protagonist to grace the screen since Dave Batista's daughter in the zombie movie he did for Netflix. The action is almost non existent, which would be fine if there was interesting dialogue, character development or the plot advances. People are so quick to heap praise on mediocrity now, that it's ridiculous. Whether it be The Peripheral, Game of Thrones prequel, Wednesday, etc. They all are worthy of a watch, but these 9/10 ratings should be rare, but people just heap praise where it isn't deserved.

Sure it's not 100% of the game story, but i really enjoy this show. I think because the tv show have a better toch to feel for side characters, the background stories and as far you can speak of it in a fantasy show, ""Realism""

The game have a lot of ""a little to much"" moments, where the tv show feels more natural with vulnerable main characters. (In the game you take high risks, because there is a reset when you die, ofcourse in a tv show there isn't such an option)

But I really like how the characters develop and how the story is true to the original story with it's own touch to it. What one of the best things is, is how we in the tv show learn about the fungus and how it developed, spread and infected people al over the world."

I have not found one character that I am hoping is successful. Bella character is just a brat and needs to go away, Pedro's character is not likeable. The writing is predictable and boring. The actor is slow and I tend to stop paying attention.

The other part the is annoying is main charters that a fighting for survival that leave weapons behind. It happened in episode 2, room full of military weapons and they couldn't even pick up hand grenades, episode 3 a basement full of weapons and again no leave them. It like watching a 3 rate horror movie.

Episode 3 was a complete snooze fest. I was so bored I got up and went to the kitchen for a snack and didn't even rewind to see what I missed because it had nothing to do with the main plot. It was noting but filler, it was like watch a 20 minute fight scene in an action movie, you know the outcome and just waiting to get back to the main plot.

After 3 episodes don't think I will return. To slow, bori.g and predictable. Sorry."

My only comment is they should have castes a girl that actually looks more like ""Ellie"" but it's a major issue.

The way the events unfold and the visuals left me speechless and we couldn't have asked for more.

The person who is in charge of photography, as well as the director, should be honored with the highest awards, because they knew exactly what it means to respect the fandom of the franchise and deliver for us some thing that we can actually relate to while watching this show and what shocked me, the most is the attention to details even in the tiniest Spots and so many mutual marks that we got to see in the game what a present in this show which only confirms the dedication from the entire team behind this series to deliver some thing that will be good enough for the game franchise fans.

Well done to all of them, and I hope other studios can learn from the team behind the last of us series. That's when you want to adopt some thing from a video game. It must be done by the book and well executed, and the last of us just set the bar so high for others."

I didn't expect for the directors to go this in dept with certain characters but I'm so glad they did because it makes the characters feel more human and you can relate to them more than you could in the game. Everything is top notch including the music which the main title/opening page song is also ripped straight from the game. You can also tell just how much love was brought into this project."

Just what we all need to see and what we have already seen again and again and again.

Another end-of-the-world plant based zombie apocalypse story, based on a real badly rated children's video game!

There is nothing original or new to this type of Si-fi genre. Terrible script. The script has been taken from a hundred other scripts all mashed together based on the same concept, again, ZOMBIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!! When will the writers ever come up with original Si-fi concepts based on something else other than zombies.

And the sarcastic flippant teenager character is just annoying. Like finger nails scratching across a blackboard. Extremely bad wring and extremely bad acting. A British actress trying to put on an American accent.

Episode 3. Why????????????"

Permalink";"I must say I was expecting something exceptional, looking at the rating and the reviews. But my gilfriend fell asleep in the middle of the first episode, though we watched the second to see if there is some kind of plot twist that would make this show worth the score it has (9,3 currently).

Well, there isn't. Effects are nice, but you can reek the videogame from the way the plot set up, eg. ""get there through the subway"", ""the only way is through the musem"" because all the surrounding streets are unpassable. Just like single levels in a videogame (I have not played the game).

What is all boils down to is yet another zombie roadshow, where the plot is straightforward with a ""chosen one"", that has to reach a distant place, passing far through an uncharted territory full of dangers. I can pretty surely predict what happens on the way and what happens when they get there - it will be overrun by zombies, and some main character will die.

The only difference from similar movies and series is the fungus theme, which looks exactly like in movie ""Annihilation"", that was much more interesting to watch. Is that enough for yet another zombie show? I don't believe so.

All in all: It's good for killing time, but don't expect anything special."

This was clearly a filler episode. The love story was great but didn't need an entire episode. Also they took out one of the best parts of the game. I'm assuming this was for budget purposes being it would have been more costly to follow the game. Now when I tell someone to watch the show I have to tell them they can skip ep3. Again great love story but it was so boring it lost the effect they were going for. Hopefully they learn from this episode and don't do it again."

Permalink";"I'm always skeptical, when a video game title makes it to film media, especially when it's one of those games that are so great, they could be considered art on par with the art-world's Da Vinci and as a fan of the game, I allowed myself no more than cautious excitement.

However, that changed during the first episode and now I am not just excited but completely sucked in. Already during the pilot, the intro-sequence of the game is caught so perfectly that you can feel the chaos, powerlessness and desperation through the actor's great delivery, the outstanding camerawork and the set and sound design. I would go as far as to say that the first episode is as close to flawless as anything can be.

It is not about making a complete 1-1 copy of the game. Gaming is another medium and so it is about translating it to fit the medium you're using. Needless to say, the directors and writers have done an extraordinarily good job. I look forward to seeing this series earn its place among ones like Breaking Bad, Sopranos and the like and never be another Walking Dead."

If you were worried about this just because it's a video game adaptation then please give it a chance. The source material only stands as a base for a new medium to tell some beautiful and gruelling stories in an amazingly crafted world.

The casting of the characters not only compliment their game counterparts but bring so much dynamic ability to the silver screen. If you were holding yourself back then don't because Pedro Pascal plays this role to a t. The whole supporting cast is incredible and will keep you hooked even in the shows downtime."

Permalink";"To begin, I've played the first game, and watched my friends play and analyze its story.

The game itself is, in my opinion, the gold standard of cinematic video games. Profound, funny, epic, and quiet. A story worth revisiting and one worthy of the title of masterpiece.

With that out of the way, I was horrified at the prospect of one of the best games I've ever played being turned into a TV show. Looking back at other adaptations, such as Netflix's Death Note and the fumble of The Witcher's writers hating the source material; I was quite skeptical and downright cynical at the prospects of this show.

After looking into the group working on the show and their love of the source material, I gained some hope.

While I watched the first episode, I was amazed to recognize exact lines from scenes in the game's prologue. There is an obvious passion to ensure that this show succeeds in the same way as the game.

Finally in judging this show without the context of the game. I have never been swayed emotionally as much as I have watching this show. I cried every episode. The ability of this show to instill the feelings of despair, hope, fear, loneliness, desperation, and love is second to none. The best compliment I give to stories is if they can capture the ideal of ""bitter-sweet""; and I believe this show achieves that goal.

I cannot wait to see more."

Permalink";"I'm not here to comment on the relationship to the video game this show is adapted from, I don't play games like that and don't know or care anything about them. From a purely cinematic point of view, this show is excellent thru the three episodes I have seen so far. Art direction and set decoration is superb, as is cinematography. Performances range from adequate to damn good. Writing is topnotch, I was not expecting much from a show with this one's premise -- I don't even bother watching any of the ""Walking Dead"" shows for that reason -- but the way in which they introduced the storyline, the various backstories, the human consequences and endurance of catastrophe, are all very well constructed and detailed, dialog is appropriately sparse yet nothing important is left out.

In particular, S1E3 is one of the most dramatically beautiful episodes of any show I've ever seen, thanks to the lovely guest performances of Nick Offerman and Murray Bartlett, and the poignant voice of the glorious Linda Ronstadt in the soundtrack. That episode alone deserves 10 out of 10 stars. Since it's early yet, I'm reserving judgment on the overall series and being conservative with that rating, (the 8 is really 8.5 rounded down), but I'm definitely looking forward to the rest of the season.

Edited 3/14/23:... I'm inclined to downgrade the show overall after watching the season-ending 9th episode. I would say the first 8 episodes deserve a 9 out of 10 stars rating, but the awful insanity of the 9th episode brings it back down to a 7 now. There is no acceptable excuse for what the writers made Joel do in episode 9, regardless of the grossly cold explanation they offered in the post-episode interviews. If Joel does not get the death he deserves in S2E1, I will probably stop watching after that. But I may stop watching anyway, just because I don't see any point to the show continuing with or without his now thoroughly ruined character -- the development of his relationship with Ellie is one of the crucial things that made it work so well for 8 episodes, and it was a relationship that had a foundation of honesty, which has just been shattered for no good reason. Regardless of any statement to the contrary, Ellie must always have doubts about Joel's morality and truthfulness going forward, and I have no desire to see that played out."

However, while there has been good action in the first episodes, what makes this show different (and amazing) is the storytelling. Although this is a series with a full season plot, it is somewhat episodic and the adept writing and acting helped me care about more than just the main characters. The third episode in particular told a story I that was completely unexpected.

The fact that this show has everyone searching the internet for the potential reality of the premise for this particular downfall of humanity should say a lot.

Even if you've watched other ""end of the world"" series, you owe it to yourself to watch this one."

Acting consists of everyone looking wide-eyed going through the motions of being action heroes in a calamity with the only back story being that which is irrelevant and makes ya wonder why you watched the first half of episode 1. Bad writing, formulaic, annoying characters who are boring at best. High reviews must be from targeting gamer audiences to boost reviews, I don't know.

Episode 3 really hits the heart. I've read reviews on here critizing episode 3, but I'd say those people probably don't have a heart. Because I'm embarrassed, I left the old review below. I was wrong. Watch it!

....I can't believe all the high ratings. There is no way you can tell me this many people watched two episodes and rated this high - no way. Granted the beginning was intriging, but went downhill fast.

I'm trying to get into the show, but I don't think the actors can keep a straight face with this juvenile script, the dialogue sounds like it was written by a child on ritalin. Speaking of children, the little girl who they're supposedly saving, seems annoyed by it all, with her spurty, uncaring performance. Awful.

I made through episode two, but it took me about a dozen sittings to do it. I am however, left with a range of emotions none good. What a waste of time."

I was pretty curious the way the series would be, but I have to admit I am impressed so far. Sure, Bella in the series doesn't look much like Ellie in the game but it's obvious Bella is nailing Ellie character in every other aspect so far.

The plot picks up nicely in Episode 2, after the intro of some of the characters in Episode 1. There is nothing to suggest it won't get better as the series progresses. Considering that Naughty Dog crew is present here suggests this will be a success just as the game was.

I also love the fact that they've decided to alter the series from the game somewhat and that the plot isn't 1:1 with the game. Also, incidents that weren't explained in depth in the game are picked up here in more detail; ref. The story between Frank and Bill in Episode 3.

Definitely worth watching! I'll give it 9/10 because it's still early but judging by how well Episode 2 was made I reckon this will be a banger of a series!"

Ellie comes across as a know-it-all brat in this iteration of The Last of Us, which is off putting.

The building and sets looked way too fake and polished. If there was any immersion then this certainly takes you out of it.

It's something many producers and showrunners refuse to understand: If you already have a hundred million FANS you don't need a different audience or a different story. It happened several times with Resident Evil in the past, it happened again last year with HALO (my worst disappointment). Fortunately this is not the case for 'The Last of us'. The story is respected, even a little improved, im my opinion. Don't forget, I'm referring to those who played it, that some of the scenes were built and invented to replace the player's actions in the original game, and surprisely they works. I also agree with those who say that 9/10 is an exaggerated grade, but if you look at the grades that HALO got at the first episode (compared to this it would be worth 4) my 9 is to make a clear distinction. Maybe Microsoft/Paramaunt will now understand where and what they went wrong."

Permalink";"Story: This is the regular zombie apocalypse plotline that we all know and love, but with a twist regarding the nature of the infection, adding some interesting new elements. The story is mostly well-executed. There are a number of cliches, but admittedly they are hard to avoid in such a well-explored genre, with The Walking Dead as the obvious forerunner. There were some issues with slow pacing in the second half of the first episode, where I feared the show would lose momentum and devolve into a passive dialogue-driven drama, but this was quickly alleviated in the second episode which keeps you on the edge of your seat and wanting more. The show shines the strongest with few characters on screen, exploring the post-apocalyptic world with the accompanying life-or-death struggles.

Immersion and worldbuilding: Probably the strongest point of the show. The production value is absolutely incredible, the visuals are stunning, and it makes everything believable and amplifies the drama and the plot. The (ambient) soundtrack fits very well when it's used, and most importantly they also know when not to use it.

Acting: There are two main characters. Pedro Pascal as Joel works very well, although it is arguably a simple role to play with Joel being a fairly closed and stoic figure. Ellie is played by Bella Ramsay. Bella is actually 5 years older than the character she portrays. This is a little disappointing, with shows like Stranger Things recently proving that child actors can play main characters, and I feel this choice somewhat negatively affects the impression of the character. In the story, Ellie apparently is supposed to be a bratty kid, complaining a lot and quite naive (of course). But, acted by a 19 year old, you instead get the impression of a young woman acting like a child, throwing tantrums, and that she just needs to pull herself together. It reduces the sympathy and tolerance for stupidity you have for the character. You get used to it, but it was quite annoying initially when they were establishing the character's personality."

Whenever you want something worthwhile you get something old. Whenever something needs to work it doesn't work. Car suddenly does not start. Phone does not work. Gun does not fire. Lighter does not light... And so on.

Pedro Pascal isn't at his best, Narcos and Mando were so so better.

Bella is great ngl.

Camera is great also. I love colors.

Production surprisingly isn't great though. It's like a good Netflix show. Worse than Chernobyl, worse than GoT and even worse than True Detective. It's a shame.

Dialogues are CW like. Trying to be edgy and wholesome and in the end worse than both.

The last two episodes are rushed according to critics so I'm not invested in this show.

It's annoying, distracting, and breaks immersion.

I can only guess that having a hand-held camera is an intentional decision to distract viewers from the fact that the show is very unoriginal, and brings absolutely nothing new to the genres of zombies and post-apocalypses. At least not in the first two episodes.

It's full of tired tropes from the genres, that's already been done to death.

It's also very predictable, and the story progression is painfully slow. Not much happening, really.

The acting is good, and the special effects are ok.

The show would have been ok, and at least watchable, if it hadn't been for the shaky camera. I mean, not every show or movie has to reinvent the genre and surprise viewers with something original, but the shaky camera is a real dealbreaker.

I also really don't understand the hype for this show. I haven't played the game, though, but i probably will when it's released on Steam. Hopefully it's better than this show."

Yes, it's big budget, but it *shows*, unlike the ridiculous HotD garbage heap that cost twice as much with no payoff.

Excited to see where this is headed. Loving the performances from Bella Ramsey, Pedro Pascal, and Anna Torv. Bella especially knocking it out of the park with her American accent and an expertly nuanced performance that layers sarcasm, bravado, and anger with turns of youthful optimism, fear, and naïveté. She's delivered some pretty strong performances for her age.

Anyway, off we go. Let's see what happens next."

You know a show is bad/ boring/ drawn out when your finger is on the skip button for most of an episode and you miss absolutely nothing. Not once did I skip back to check something.

They're capitalizing on the fact that the game has fans, but if this continues, this won't last for sure.

The rating 9+ is actually comical. This show in on par with Game of thrones and breaking bad? Like in what universe? It's not Even on par with the walking dead and I didn't even like it that much.

If you want a proper sci-fi, go watch Raised by Wolves."

The first episode was good and action packed but no better than the first episode of walking dead and the likes. Nothing about it spoke 10 / 10 for me as it's just like any of those zombie shows. It's only early but I don't see it being on par with the greats like the wire , the sopranos , breaking bad just as it's not an original concept .

It looks like it's been over hyped the gamers who have now watched this and It's definitely not a realistic 10/10 ."

The reviews scoring this a 9 or 10 are drinking the kool aid. Anything below a 5 and you are prob a hater. It's a solid 7 show. Not great not terrible.

That said I think the casting director should take the L on this show not being great. I feel like they tried to be to on the nose for each character that it's a bit of an eye roll. Super macho dude with mustache, sarcastic ""tough"" girl, blah."

I haven't played the games so I have no idea if the show is anything like the games, nor do I care if they are or aren't. After hearing how great this series is, how fantastic the first two episodes were, I couldn't wait to see them and boy was I disappointed. That's what happens when you listen to 'game fanboys' I guess. It's not that the show is 'bad', it isn't, but the problem is that there are better 'zombie' shows around, so I felt like I was watching a show that was just copying these other zombie shows. Hell, even Z Nation is much more entertaining and interesting than The Last of Us.

Saying that, if you have never seen another Zombie series, maybe you would think this is the bees knees. Otherwise, don't expect more than a rehash of what's been shown before in other shows.

Will I continue watching the rest of the series? I think I'll watch a couple more episodes and then decide if to continue watching more. So far, I am giving it a 5/10, because I found I was bored while watching it. The actors were fine, just the plot was boring, like I mentioned above, just a repetition of other zombie shows. I don't believe people are giving this anything above a 6/10. No way. At least these first 2 episodes hasn't warranted higher than that."

As i am only on episode one it is gonna be really good to see what they have done with the clickers and infected.... how they are goong to capture the great scenen in the game where stealthmode is required... it is a favorite element of the fights with the infected.

Permalink";"The intro sequence was poor, lazy exposition dump from a trio of characters that we never see or hear from again. It's like a scrolling title card from a B movie.

After 10 minutes of some stuff with Joel and his kid, we see a zombie. The show is literally a copy and paste of The Walking Dead without anything that I was expecting from a mutated fungus infecting the people of the world. They have depicted everything as just zombies.

Within the first episode there is an inexcusable time skip of 20 years. The show is now disconnected and boring, compared to what I was enjoying with the main guy and his daughter.

The next problem is a bunch of political nonsense and annoying characters take over in the first episode. The worst of all is Ellie, how did this actor get this role? She can't seem to act and it makes the scenes awkward for the others. Another issue for me is the character is shown as an annoying brat and is a hard 180 turn from the daughter character we met earlier.

In my opinion a whole season should have been used for the pandemic spread period, and then next season move time on a bit. The way HBO did it creates a whiplash effect because the time skip content is so poorly written and acted.

4/10 below average writing and presentation that misses the mark set from the source material. In my option worse than Black Summer and The Walking Dead, even with all the flaws I noted on those."

If you've thought Pedro Pascal was brilliant in GOT, Narcos and several other movies he has so flawlessly been great in wait till you see him as Joel in this show. He has put on a hell of a performance and the funny thing is he is not even the best actor in this show. Words aren't enough to praise how good Bella Ramsey is. There couldn't be more perfect Elle. She steals the show every time she is on the frame. The cinematography, lighting, acting and cast are so well put you have to hand it to HBO for making this series.

Again, great series but I wouldnt go in expecting the best series since sliced bread because I was def disappointed a little. Also, the young female lead is quite horrible at acting, every line seems forced :/ and I just feel there are better options. So, in summary GREAT SHOW, just don't go in expecting a 9.3 rated series because it should land more on the 7.5 spectrum."

I've watched two episodes so far and just can't see 9.3, it's not ground breaking or novel in any way and I think the rating is way ott. It's quite predictable and expected in many ways and the acting isn't brilliant, just average. I'll keep watching and hopefully it will improve, as a TV series it has to stand by itself and not rely on adaptations or original format.

First and foremost, the main thing a show MUST have is great actors, with charisma and screen presence who can make you forget you are watching TV and they enable you to get immersed in the show.

Pedro Pascal fits the bill, but he is the only good actor here and the others simply detract from the experience.

Bella Ramsay is wrong for this in every way. Her looks are off putting and she lacks the acting chops and charisma to carry this role.

By the second episode, the story is already slow, plodding and totally boring.

I remember the first few episodes of Walking Dead, which were so rivetting, with great actors, you just got immediately immersed in it.

Not so here.

Move on, nothing to see."

Each episode is so addictive and you just want to see more of it. Play the game or not, Last Of Us is beautifully done. Bella Ramsey and Pedro Pascal both knock there roles out of the park over and over. They're acting feels so real but the dialog is written in a fun way. Nothing in the show is slow, it builds a compelling story and does so in a new way. How you get the virus in general is a really creepy, well done way to do a zombie virus show. Overall this is an incredible show. The only reason its not a 10/10 is because I want to wait until season 1 finishes before giving it any further rating."

I like Vince Gilligan, Peter Gould. Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul. Never thought about something being even close. But Chernobyl was great. So is The Last Of Us.

First time I like a zombie thing in general. But it is about the details and the effort the creators put into it. At marvel and sometimes Disney, they think a green screen is enough. No, it is not. Or the volume, which is great of course, and can create a lot. But no, it is not.

The same applies here. The fanboys (and girls) cheer the realization of an epic computer game as if this production would redefine the genre.

There are no innovations to be seen here. Of course, the effects and production design are very good and true to the original. The story is told in an exciting way. But you have to make compromises when it comes to the cast. For the role of Joel, I couldn't think of anyone better than Pedro Pascal, chapeau! But Ellie? Sorry, Bella Ramsey just doesn't fit at all to portray this ambiguous personality, on the one hand tender and on the other brave and self-sacrificing. She's more like the elephant in the china shop!

After two episodes, it is of course too early to give a final rating of a series. In this respect, we are eagerly awaiting what THE LAST OF US will offer us in terms of (hopefully) enjoyable entertainment!"

Very meh acting overall including Tess's actress. I don't understand why it's so hard for these companies, they always miss the mark because they need to add thier own flare, when the reason the game was a hit, was because of how the story was made, no need to change it up.

Chernobyl was done very well and honestly thats the bar of my expectations. And, since I thought the walking dead was really good until about season 6 I figured maybe this would be on par. So, it was anticipation that had me hoping this would be good. Such a let down. Tbh, I have a feeling this is going to drag as we all keep hoping it's going to get better but it won't...

Two episodes in, the quality of TV has gone down tremendously if you think this is well done. It's not breaking bad, stranger things or any of those tops shows. 9.4? I think in a year it's going to be a low 6 at best. The acting isn't that great, the writing is horrible, the cgi is eh, has a cheap feel to it like some family show on cm or something.

I didn't want to be hasty in my review but it's been challenging to get through the first two episodes. It sucks to watch new show after new show lower the bar.

Edit* Just watched Episode 3, while I personally cringe at homo characters making out on screen as that's not very pleasant to endure, I really enjoyed the rest of the episode. Never would have expected that from Nick Offerman (Parks and Rec) and I really enjoyed Murray Bartlett in The White Lotus. But, they brought entertainment to the episode, it was good. So, it went up 1 star for me."

Permalink";"(Traslated by google translate ) Im honestly impressed by the whole movie.

As someone who played the first and second parts of the last of us game, watched a lot of movies and spent at least eighteen years of his life playing video games from computer to PlayStation, Sega and Atari, I must say this was dope and legit🔥 It is really worth thanking the filming, sound recording, lighting and logistics team of this series, especially its wonderful direction.

The beginning of the series stunningly nailed the viewer to the place of watching it, and the rhythm of the film continuously returned from slow to fast and from fast to slow just like the scenes in the game.

And we should really thank for the excellent writing of this series, which was not expected to work so well As a gamer, I have to say that no game that has been turned into a movie or series has thrilled me as much as these few published episodes of this series, so that you could find similar scenes and dialogues between the movie and the game. The history of cinema and games like this is unique.

The actors perform brilliantly in every scene and for every role, but every good thing has a big weakness. The big weakness of this series is its main character, Eli's character. The actor who played the role of Eli had no similarity in height, body and face (especially the actor's nose) with the main character in the game. Eli was be rude and smart and angry, violent and emotional and act unexpectedly, but the only thing we saw in this series is a theatrical character, very cold (like yougert), annoying and childish, as if her parents They were recently divorced and had no goofy character at all and presented a very artificial acting, the only thing similar to Ellie's character was her voice. I suggest that now because of Hollywood and its ridiculous policies, which can be to get money from the actor or to make an inexperienced actor famous in a very important and popular series for the next series with other genres or for any other reason, this series should be continued. Don't spoil it because of this actor, many people agree with me that the actor should be replaced with another actor in the adult role of Eli because it is too late to replace the current character at this age of the movie character and Hollywood hit Carrie.

If the actor in the series is not replaced in the second part of the last of us game, it will lose viewership and ratings for many reasons, and it will ruin the entire efforts of the series so well that it will become very boring and boring."

Well acted, very well filmed and obviously including a very high budget, I was gripped and thinking that this was going to be brilliant but then a major flaw occurred.

Ellie appeared and the girl playing her is just so wrong and doesn't fit the part AT ALL. I suppose it would be more of an issue to those who have played the game as we are used to Ellie and how she acts but here it just does not work in any degree. Bella Ramsay is totally wrong for this role and they could have used the actress who plays Joel's daughter to play Ellie. She was excellent in the few scenes that she appeared in and would have been a terrific Ellie. Pedro Pascal is fine as Joel but the casting of Ellie is a hurdle I'm not sure I will be able to overcome which is a shame. I honestly feel that ratings will fall after a few episodes.

UPDATE Have now watched episode 2 and it was a bit on the boring side. Bella Ramsay was a touch better but still not right for the role in my opinion. I think this is overrated."

Permalink";"The Last of Us TV series is finally here and it's absolutely incredible! If you're a fan of the video game series or just love post-apocalyptic stories, then you need to tune in. The series follows the journey of Joel, a smuggler, and Ellie, a teenage girl, as they traverse through a United States ravaged by a fungal pandemic that has turned most of humanity into infected monsters. The story is set in a post-apocalyptic world, where the majority of humanity has been wiped out by a deadly fungus and the survivors are forced to fight for survival in a world overrun by dangerous creatures.

The acting performances by Pedro Pascal as Joel and Bella Ramsey as Ellie are phenomenal. They both give powerful and emotionally charged performances that capture the essence of the characters from the video game perfectly. The pacing of the series is also on point, with a good balance of action, suspense and character development that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the episodes.

The visual effects are also jaw-dropping, creating a realistic and detailed world that immerses you in the post-apocalyptic setting. The series also explores themes such as the cost of survival, the power of love and sacrifice, and the importance of family and community in a world where humanity is on the brink of extinction.

The second episode aired on July 25th and it picks up right where the first episode left off, with Joel and Ellie continuing their journey. The episode continues to impress with its storytelling, acting performances, and production values, and even introduces new characters and a deeper exploration of the infected.

Overall, The Last of Us TV series is a must-watch and it's not to be missed. It's a perfect blend of action, suspense, and character development that keeps you engaged throughout the episodes. If you haven't watched it yet, don't wait any longer, tune in now."

His performance is convincing and layered, can't wait to see how he dives into other parts of Joel's journey. Gabriel Luna steals the show in every scene he's in... his tommy is maybe one of the closest to the game... his accent, the body language, it's all a very good Tommy!

And Bella Ramsey kills it as Ellie, her Ellie is smart, quick with her words and knife! Her performance is perhaps one of the best you'll ever come across.

The direction and writing is as high level as it can get, scenes feel engaging even when little action is happening and characters feel familiar even at first sight... the writers captured the tone perfectly and the set design implements that very tone to every scene.

To sum it all up, HBO's The Last of Us is a outstanding piece of television which stays true to it's source, but keeps veteran fans on their toes with respectful changes to the story."

It was surprisingly good, the first episodes especially hit hard. I had to amend this for the 3rd episode which for whatever reason hit harder to me.

But if you knew the story and premise you'd expect it from the first two. The second's ep, especiallly climax, had some missed opportunities for emotional engagement and felt lackluster for some reason. The 3rd although completely non-canonical apart from two characters being together with the same names and is totally different. I'm kind of astonished (as I had to research it due to not recalling that, but yeah those story's 2 diff themes I reckon)

I think I am a bit offput by casting. I do love diversity and inclusion so am all for pedro pascal as he killed it in narcos. But Bella Ramsey's Ellie seemed far grittier and not very resemblent of the canon character (whereas I pictured a younger Ellen Page for some reason). Maybe she'll grow on me. I'm stoked they have the game writer doing like active participation in the showrunning and process.

I mean almost to a fault it follows the games (albeit some much needed/appreciated backstory for explanation which the games lacked cause they're.. just games) but it'd be nice for original plot lines to be interwoven. But the first game had such a perfect story (except the end IMO, although I don't know what I would've preferred otherwise) so I look forward to seeing more of it!

First review! Thank you."

Permalink";"First, I really like the original game, Last of us, and I do think that the game is one of the best video games of all time. I mean, how often do you get to see and play a video game that makes you cry your eyes out? The amazing thing about this show is that the production value is superb. It's as great as any blockbuster movies. The quality of SFX and CGI is truly amazing. However, my problem with the show is the cast. The cast is abysmal, and I'm not only talking about the resemblance of the original characters. 2 episodes in, it's still hard to engage to the characters. Tess is much older and not as powerful as the original. I know she is not a main character, but still she's an important character. The problem with Joel in the show is that it doesn't have the special transition of how Joel transforms from rough and tough angry bear to daddy bear. Pedro Pascal looks like a kind and protective daddy bear already. Last but not least, Ellie is the worst of all. I'm really sorry to say this, but there's a big problem with her acting. Her facial expressions depending on the emotions, they look all the same. Whether she's anxious, angry or happy. There's no distinction among them. Ellie in the video game shows much diverse facial expressions. Funny and interesting thing is that clickers in the show look so much scarier and realistic than the ones in the game. I might continue watching the show just for the clickers, but I think the 3rd episode will be my last since I know who plays Bill in the show. I don't think they ruin it by any means. This isn't a bad show, but if I didn't know about the original game at all, I would probably enjoyed a lot except Ellie."

And I'm so pleasantly surprised by how much Bella exudes that Ellie essence. People are complaining about looks however their looks are not essential to the plot. The acting is and so far they're exquisite!! I've played the games back and forth a few times and it's exciting to see some of my favorite scenes brought to life and the clickers are even more terrifying brought to life. I have no doing that the remaining 7 episodes will be just as seeing Drucmmam is so heavily involved!"

This feels like it could be really good, but if it's nonstop fighting the infected, then it's going to get old fast. It needs to show some kind of pursuit of a cure; again I haven't played the game. I'm not a fan of the girl Playing Ellie, she's pretty obnoxious honestly.

Also, It might just be me but why do shows have to have so much obscene language? Does every other word in a heightened intense moment need to be ""F"" this ""F"" that, ""F"" you??? It's a bit moronic to be honest. Intelligent people don't talk like that nonstop. I just finished watching ""A Quiet Place"" & ""A Quiet Place II"" and those movies have hardly any spoken lines and they were amazing!!!

Some reviews say that the third episode is one of the (if not the) best of the series even though it's probably the episode that will derive from the original story the most.

I'm really glad that we have access to much more content in the story that didn't make it through the original game, such as the background relationship between Bill & Frank, Ellie's mom, etc...

The visuals are stunning, each scene is a chef's kiss of visual and practical effects, and the clickers feel so real it's almost frightening!"

Actors are well chosen, I mean like Eli, she is so fit in the role that they should remaster the game with her character.

Although at first it's seemed like they're changing too much, but as it goes to the quarantine zone it get's better.

It's been a while since they announced it, no wonder it came out that good.

It's similar to the game, and seems to be following the games pretty well, but we need to watch more to see if Joel and Ellie are playing as Joel and Ellie the way fans hope for. So far it's okay. It's watchable, entertaining, people who haven't played the games would probably enjoy this a lot.

Joel is okay, I'm not the biggest fan of Ellie so far, I think if the writers and director actually had her play the games that she would've gotten the character better."

It's gripping, emotional, special effects are amazing and the characters are spot on. I was worried when the trailer came out but very excited anyway, even if you don't play the game you'll have no issues with following the show. Everyone will love it, especially those that like shows like the walking dead.

Uh, I need more characters, so I guess on a personal note I'll write that in the two episodes released it hasn't needlessly sexualised women for pervy men out there. I don't understand americas obsession with seeing every female actresses boobs and nude women but this is one of the american shows that seems as though it wont go in that direction and one american show I'll actually watch."

But after this observation we can only ask ourselves: ""Is this another series that will revolve around zombies and that will be endless?"" To this question we can already answer: yes. Don't get me wrong, the series is really okay for now. But only for the moment because it seems obvious that it will not keep this pace in the long term. I strongly advise you not to get attached to it in order to avoid what TWD fans are currently going through.

So yeah, good series for now, but it's gonna suck, I guarantee it."

On an adventure level, there was none. Suspense ? There was none. Mystery, none. Action? None. Human drama? None. Thought provoking future doom ? None.

Practically none of the film would've been any different without the apocalypse.....essentially any tale of freedom fighters in a Dictatorship would do. And quite incredible that, yes! There is a ""chosen one"". Like it was done by numbers.

I love SciFi, Fantasy, Disaster movies, and Computer Games.

This was none of those. At best it was like an overextended poor Doctor Who Episodes.

Permalink";"First two episodes started out amazing and I was hooked. I don't like zombie shows but this caught me.

Then it went downhill. Not in production quality or acting. But how they decided to tell the story. Now on episode 7 - the side characters has far more character chemistry and development than the main two characters. I don't care about the same gender relationships, that's hinted in the game. What I do care about is that they are trying to take the magic of breaking bad - being able to have a slow pacing and a slow build up to the action - but the last of us fails miserably. It's just slow. It's boring. The pacing is way off. I don't feel the main characters. Bella Ramseys character has three modes. 1. Swear mode. 2. Stuck up mode. 3. Reaction mode. She has zero personality and Joel... It's hinted that he's an absolutely maniac and a bad ass.... But the few, few things we see him do... Are not in any way extraordinary to give him that reputation.

Some characters are new and are horribly miscast. I'm talking about Rose from 2 and a half men. I don't even remember her characters name. What the....

The reunion with Tommy was heartbreakingly flat.

There is so much greatness from the game and they literally decided to make it worse. Not different - but worse.

Absolutely loved the first two episodes and haven't been so hyped since breaking bad or the dark knight.

So it starts amazing - then it's a slow, slow, slow process of side characters that show up and seem important. Then they die asap from 2 min of action.

It's just a poor adaption and after re-watching the game play it feels like empty virtue signaling and money problems driving this show..... How can you have so little things going on in a zombie human apoclapyse..."

Therefore, I decided to give it a try. I knew nothing going in, and had no idea it was based on a video game. Can't say that I wasn't disappointed to discover that this is yet another zombie iteration. Nevertheless, the show is well done, and the actors are very good. However, I couldn't help but see the obvious parallels to Alfonso Cuaron's Children of Men based an story arc (minus the zombies), cinematography, and direction. I have to assume that the producers of the show and/or video game are huge fans of the Cuaron's bleak, dystopian masterpiece. Whatever the case, give the show a try."

Permalink";"After having watched two episodes of ""The Last of Us"", it appears to me that the format is very different from all the other zombie movies and shows that are out there. And as to why this is, I haven't yet got a good explanation for it. One thing that speaks for this show, is that I am totally NOT a fan of the zombie genre: I even have a total dislike for the hugely popular ""The Walking Dead"". I however like ""The Last of Us"". And honestly said... I like it a lot! And mind you that I never played the videogame that it is based on. Actually, I didn't even know of the existence of that videogame.

What I experienced whilst watching episode 2, is something akin to what I felt like when watching ""Alien"" for the first time. The type of suspense, 'the unknown', the battle for survival and mystery surrounding the 'predator' all makes me think of the 'Alien-experience'.

I am also very impressed by the interesting 'science' that is behind ""The Last of Us"". I was so intrigued by the first minutes of episode 1 - where they showed a talkshow from the 60's with a scientist raising the threat of funghi for human life - that I delved myself into the background of funghi. And the fact that funghi are able to gain control of e.g. Ants is a proven fact. So this makes it all a bit more credible than most of the other content in the zombie-genre. ""The Last of Us"" seems to be based on a way more credible scientific foundation, and that makes it for me way more interesting.

Also lets not forget that the cast is sublime. Instead of the usual 'good looking' youngsters that we see in the zombie-genre - let's call them the high school star athletes and cheerleaders - ""The Last of Us"" takes a different approach. By for instance chosing for Pedro Pascal, who has become popular for the more serious roles, the producers of ""The Last of Us"" took a completely different direction. And also this fact makes this show way different from what we usually see with zombie shows.

It is obvious that this show is supported by excellent CGI. The scenes are just stunning! And apart from the CGI, we also get to see insanely beautiful dressed 'infected humans'.

I have to say that I am pretty enthusiastic about ""The Last of Us"". By taking a way different approach to the usual zombie genre, I think that the producers took a risk. But the ones that take risks, also have the chance to be rewarded. And this show deserves to be rewarded big time! I was so impressed by episode 1 that I could do no different than give it a score of 10/10. Episode 2 was also great! It deserves a score of 9.3/10. I know that it is only two episodes that are at this moment released, but ""The Last of Us"" seems to have all ingredients for becoming a hugely successful franchise."

Permalink";"I'm a huge fan of TLOU games and so far I'm loving the live-action adaptation. Pedro Pascal (Joel) and Bella Ramsey (Elle) aren't perfect matches to the game characters but both have, so far been, the perfect fit. Let's not forget the haunting music of Gustavo Santaolalla!

I find that the the change in the cordyceps infection method used in the show is completely unnecessary and actually takes away from the tension of the story and locations.

The use of spores in the game was much more subtle but nonetheless, effective. The spores were a passive danger that were an omnipresent danger. Limiting access or giving indication that infected are near.

Additionally, at the beginning of the first episode, the interviewers describes cordyceps as unable to infect humans as they can't survive in 98.6 degrees of our bodies... yet. Of course, alluding to climate change making the cordyceps more resilient to heat. But, without spoiling. Heat far above human body temperatures would have eliminated the ""new"" transmission method.

I do like the addition of the ""mycelium network"" as a means of alerting other infected but again, they're placing too much emphasis on the infected as a danger.

The real enemy in the game, in the world of TLOU, was not the infected... it was the human survivors and what they do to each other to."

3. The zombies look like.... I don't even know what to call it. Like a 80's movie make up. Come one!

The pilot episode has a big time jump and we never get really invested in the main characters for this season, but it does set up the situation and explain the world we find ourselves in. As a stand alone story I'd say it's less compelling than The Walking Dead but it isn't bad.

Episode 2 picks up the pace and gets us invested in the characters. Here we get to see the fantastic scenography and very impressive monsters. The story moves along briskly. All in all it's a great television episode.

If they can keep up the story development and pace from episode 2 this will be a great first season."

The series started really promising even dough I had doubts in the pick of Bella Ramsey. I still believe she is not the best pick for the Ellie role but she is playing so far exactly on point.

Pedro Pascal as Joel is so perfect that I cannot think of someone who can be a better choice.

The series are going to be a masterpiece. Greg Spence is Greg Spence.

I really love how they've added some additions on their own to the story. Things we have not seen in the game but making the series more complete.

The only thing I have notice so far which to be honest is the only ""bad"" choice they've made is Joel's daughter. Nico Parker as Sarah is nothing close to what Sarah looked and felt in the game."

Permalink";"So far this is just another zombie tv show.

Like another reviewer said, this is a clone of I am Legend with The Walking Dead. I might add War War Z and the video game Dying Light. And Yes I have played the Last Of Us game.

And, like Walking Dead, it also has seasoned zombie killers making idiotic decisions. (You are supposed to be silent, yet you attack zombies with a gun instead of a knife)

All the drama, situations, action scenes we have seen before.

I have been watching/playing zombie related entertainment for more than 35 years!

My first zombie experience was the 1979 Lucio Fulci's Zombie movie!

The only details that are ""new"" is the zombie's connection network and that the people are searching for a cure. Shows like The Walking Dead and its siblings are not interested in finding a cure or the cause for the apocalypse.

Of course I am going to keep watching the show, but I can guarantee you that it will not blow me away."

The show captivates you right from the start. Personally, I know the game, but I've never played it, so I'm not prejudiced. As a big fan of zombie apocalypses, however, it meets my taste exactly.

Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey don't look exactly like the game characters, but they don't have to. What's needed is acting talent - and both of them have it. Together with a very detailed and accurate adaptation, HBO hits the nerve here.

I hope they see the positive ratings as an incentive to give this more weight in future shows. In the general series mess that is currently being produced, a little more care like with The Last of Us would only do all studios good!"

The infected are absolutely terrifying! I think no other show comes close to the awesomeness of detail involved, and the creativity of fungus taking over is amazing!

I had to update this when ep3 came out because it made me love this show even more now, I hope they keep this series up for years to come for our entertainment.

I do wish that we got to see the falling of mankind over the 20yr period however. Things like that are important at least for me to build suspense and go all in with the fungus idea. They do however, teach us throughout the 2nd episode which is fine too - I guess chaos is what I am meaning to look for when beginning a series. By the way, there's a show on Netflix called Colony which has really good elements of this series so you may find yourself entertained by Colony too!"

Take any american post apocalyptic and its the same, hence boring. Pedro Pascal is good choice and that is the only good thing about the series. Isabella Ramsey is not even trying to act well, whats with that??

So its ok if you dont watch if you've already watched movies like I am Legend, A quiet place, Army of the dead, or american drama series The walking dead.

Honestly its not even close to Kingdom or A train to Busan."

For a zombie apocalypse based series, i think, this one have the most accuracy politically, visually, and scientifically. The major part is the science which kinda add a different kind of horror to it. LOVED IT.!!"

The first 30 minutes of Episode 1 opened great. It was riveting and suspenseful, a well done end of the world apocalypse with lots of drama and chills of 'what would I do' thoughts pacing through my own head...and then it reared itself as another beat-to-death zombie story that caps off in the quarantine zone, ultimately setting the plot for the whole season: a run across the country.

Episode 2 starts with explaining the scientifically impossible fungus anomaly that is the basis of the whole show's zombie outbreak, but ends up devoting the bulk of it's hour runtime to our protagonists just trying to navigate through a museum.

While we'll have to wait and see what the rest of the season brings us, I would say these reviews are likely being inflated by hardcore fans of the video game."

Second episode felt a bit dragged out and just like a mediacore episode of the walking dead, not even close to some of twd's best episodes.

It's nice to have a well made show that will probably keep my attention for a while, but I'm very surprised this has a rating of 9.4.., a 9.4 is near perfection , a 9.4 Is masterpiece level. This is just a good show, nothing more.

I'll change my rating if the show has more to offer later.

UPDATE: just watched the third episode and it seems that each episode gets more boring and less intriguing.

The romance in the 3rd episode could have been done better, They spent too much time on it therefore making the episode boring in my opinion while rushed at the same time. And I really can't tell if the romance had anything to really add to the overall plot.. just seemed like a filler episode.

My big problem with this episode is that it deviated so much from the other episodes. It's a show about zombies so this isn't really the time or place to dedicate an entire episode to romance.

I love romance, but not when I'm watching a zombie show. If there is romance in a zombie show, it should be done subtlety without making the show lose momentum.

This show is starting to become mediocare at best."

By far the best videogame inspired content ever created!

The show keep everything great from the game while adding a level of cinematic satisfaction to every second of it... Pedro Pascal does an amazing job as Joel. His performance is convincing and layered, can't wait to see how he dives into other parts of Joel's journey. Gabriel Luna steals the show in every scene he's in... his tommy is maybe one of the closest to the game... his accent, the body language, it's all a very good Tommy!

And Bella Ramsey kills it as Ellie, her Ellie is smart, quick with her words and knife! Her performance is perhaps one of the best you'll ever come across."

So I believe if you're a fan of the games, it might happen to you as well. You won't be impressed by the series because of two reasons:

1. You know the story.

2. Characters in the games are far more charismatic.

Pedro Pascal is so so. Bella Ramsey is not a really good choice for Ellie.

But if you've not played the games, it can be a fantastic experience. The original game has a perfect story and chemistry. And it seems like the series is gonna deliver the same feeling. It's actually the most valuable aspect of the series.

It adapts the game very well."

Acting was so-so and camera was pretty nice. Didn't played the game, but saw a game-play, and atmosphere is spot on... and that's it. Lot of characters shows up, and also some zombies. Seen a lot of times, nothing special. Second episode begin somewhere else, and that was a nice twist, couple of new characters, interesting start... but, omg, some dialogues are bad that I was ashamed to listen to them. I'm not sure is it the casting or screenplay problem, but I can tell you, it sounds silly and unconvincing. Everything is poor, from acts to acting. Scenery and camera is nice, but hey, that we already seen it in 'I am Legend' some 15 years ago. All in all, greatly exaggerated ratings. The Last of Us is actually a failed attempt to make boring characters interesting by making them mysterious... failed!"

Watching Episode 1 on our OLED in Dolby Vision & ATMOS Surround was nothing short of stunning...FULL STOP! An immersive and thrilling viewing experience.

Based only on the pilot episode, this is easily one of the best shows from HBO - an outfit not short on great television - in a very, very long time. HBO's deep pockets pay off handsomely here resulting in outstanding production values, gritty sets and seamless CGI blending. Casting is flawless, and acting across the board was nothing short of stellar. Standouts include Pascal, Ramsey, Torv and Ms. Parker.

Don't write it off as "" just another zombie show ""; it's so much more. While the show-runners don't miss a chance to show us fungi infected horrors, the Pilot makes crystal clear it is the living - not the living dead - our heroes need fear. Like the earliest episodes of TWD, the humanity shines through.

The Pilot accomplished something in ~90 minutes most shows can't throughout their entire run: I CARE about these characters!! Sundays cannot come fast enough for this viewer! HBO's The Last of Us is why the term "" Appointment Viewing "" exists. Miss this at your peril."

This early into the series and you're already thrown into a multitude of new elements and a vast and growing environment. Although it's being based off of a game, the series thus far have depicted a real and somewhat twisted baseline deriving from the game's campaign. The series has been in depth with the lore behind the fungus as well, showing the origin and creating a general knowledge of the said fungi.

Above all the makers of Chernobyl's HBO mini series have blown my expectations again, everything is made with fine detail and you can really see the work that goes into the series.

I sincerely recommend watching to any new people into TLOU."

The Last Of Us has been released 3 times (original, remaster, remaster-remaster) and apparently still needs a TV show...(???)

The character design for the monsters is well done and the environment overall is atmospheric. If you really REALLY don't want to play a video game, even on the easiest difficulty, then watch this show because the story is still interesting. The real question though is: who hasn't played the game yet and needed this show? Alternatively, why make this? What's the creative value in re-releasing something a thousand times? No value.

This is just unending misery from beginning to end (I've played both games). Again, it's made with extreme care, just don't think the package is personally worth it.

Episode one put me to sleep. Glad everyone gets to enjoy it but I'm not gonna act like anything about The Last of Us is worthy of being called a masterpiece. It's not BAD. It's just not PERFECT or even GREAT."

This series has nothing new to offer, its just like a old tea bag, might as well watch the walking dead season 56.

The game had suspense, and brought something new to the table, the tv serie on the other hand, has nothing to offer besides the hype.

The characters is like manniquins, placed only to gain some fill to a script so boresome, you simply cant believe the rating to be honest on this one.

Youre way better of playing the game, this tv series should be cancelled after 1/2 season.

This hype is unbelieveable."

Permalink";"Given the very disappointing history of game-to-film adaptations, I was getting ready to be disappointed by The Last of Us, but I am absolutely blown away. I could not have asked for more. This is by far the best adaptation of a video game ever made and I wonder why others did not have the same idea of staying faithful to the game.

Watching this series is even better than playing a third part of the video game. It brings me back to when I played Part I for the first time and was moved through a rollercoaster of emotions from the beginning to the end and beyond. Now I can sit there and be even more amazed and also watch my wife, who never played the game but occasionally watched it on the screen, feel the same emotions.

I have seen her react to the intensity of the second episode and I can't wait to see the rest.

There is nothing else to say. Please continue and please let others adapt video games to the screen JUST like this."

Permalink";"The Last of Us has FINALLY shattered the dreaded video game curse into a million pieces and then some; Craig Mazin, the man behind Chernobyl, and Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann himself, have made an adaptation for the ages, and made the seemingly impossible a reality. They finally got the video game adaptation form RIGHT! They kept the essence of the story's humanity and desperation, whilst building on top of what worked before and expanding on the areas of the story only briefly touched upon in the game.

And keep in mind, this review is based off TWO EPISODES: and it's already done what many video game movies and tv shows only dreamed of doing: becoming a respectful piece of art that transcends all the barriers of mediums, and showing a good story truly belongs anywhere. You just need the right craftsmen to honour that kind of storied legacy and expand upon the BACKSTORY in an organic way. The Last of Us respects the games perfectly whilst expanding the world we were all introduced to in 2013.

HBO may have finished Game of Thrones, The Sopranos, The Wire, Chernobyl, and maybe even True Detective, but The Last of Us shows there's plenty of creative firepower left in this television powerhouse. And Craig Mazin's fantastic sensibility for disaster in Chernobyl meshed perfectly with Neil Druckmann's cinematically-influenced storytelling and character-driven synergy.

The Last of Us has joined a growing rank of respectful video game adaptations like the Sonic films, Detective Pikachu, Sonic Boom, Castlevania, and hopefully that upcoming Mario movie will deliver the goods too. The Last of Us has set the bar PRETTY damn high, and the source material is why it was such a tall order in the first place. Takes notes, Nintendo and Microsoft. Seems that PlayStation Productions and SEGA are leading the pack right now.

Anyway, this show is fantastic; give or take the games there's STILL the phenomenal story to absorb and the timeless characters bringing life to a Godforsaken post-apocalyptic world. And yet we come back for more anyway.

The Last of Us is a television landmark for sure, and an emotional rollercoaster everyone's bound to try out. 5/5 stars."

These episodes have been amazing and very tense, love the feeling of watching these episodes when they come out. After starting to play the first game and seeing the first and second episode of the TV Show you can already tell that they are going to do justice by both video games. It seems like HBO does not seem to disappoint when it comes to video game adaptations.

I 100% recommend watching the show even if you haven't even played the games, it is a great watching experiences for all viewers gamers or not."

This adaptation is outstanding, the best video game adaptation by a country mile and very quickly becoming one of my favourite shows after 2 episodes!

Bella Ramsey and Pedro Pascal are Joel and Elle, they play their parts spectacularly especially Bella, who I'm ashamed to admit I was a little sceptical about at first, because of her physical appearance is quite different from Elle in the game but gosh was I wrong!

She captures the role and spirit of Elle from the game so well that in my mind now, she is Elle!

Absolutely outstanding!"

At first, I really did not like the casting but they really put me to shame. Pedro Pascal will definitely win many awards for this role it's absolutely incredible. I also like that they have deviated from the original storyline slightly, it makes this a much more exciting and unexpected experience. I'm sure this will go on to become one of the most popular TV Shows in the world much like The Walking Dead's success in 2010. Something like this is well overdue and I'm so grateful that it's been made. 11/10 will probably re watch 1000 times."

Very slow, boring and predictable. No blow your mind away scenes or sub plots. Acting ok, visuals ok, but that's about it. Sign of an ordinary show when everyone starts getting on their phone to check out the latest social media post and this show encourages that.

I would like to say I hope this show gets better but will not invest any more time into the next episode. Reviewers set realistic expectiaons rather than over hyping and making it a huge disappointment."

The atmosphere and ambient sound was especially good on home theatre systems so I do advise future virwing to use surround sound. I have never played the game and I can quitr easily say that if you inserted this into an episode of The Walking Dead, many viewers would simply see it as a branch of the story-arc.

It has the feel and visuals of high production values. The practical effects and prosthetics complement the story and chill and the pacing is done just right in introducing the threat that is the parasite.

Pedro is slowly becoming my favorite actor as most of his films I have rated at 8. Looking forward to Mandalorian season 3.

I enjoyed it enough to keep pushing into the next episodes. Perhaps my ratings would change."

Permalink";"Is it 1/10? Definitely not. Is it 10/10 most likely not, but time will tell. It's absurd to call the Last of Us the best series ever solely based on the pilot. There are multiple examples of series that start out well but then go downhill from there. I'm not saying the pilot was bad but even that wasn't 10/10, so please wait for the season to be over and then rate the series. I'll do the same, but for now, I have to give it 1/10 just to even out the ridiculous rating the series has at the moment.

So far the production values are good, acting is ok and the athmosphere fits the source material. However there are some really dump moments in the script that work in a game but not in a series (i.e. Tommy just go around the cars you idiot instead of going around the whole block) and that makes me doubt this series will ever be equally great as something like the Breaking Bad or the Sopranos, both which actually are a 10/10 series."

I'm glad they didn't release all the episodes at once otherwise I would not be getting any sleep. I look forward to what the next episodes will bring. The first episode was a little slow but I get they are building the story and it stays true to how part 1 of the video game started slow and built up the suspense and character stories. Episode 2 was damn good."

I was most concerned about Bella Ramsey playing Ellie, a character that I thought Noone would be able to do justice to. 2 episodes in and I'm extremely surprised and elated. The acting the atmosphere both 10s. Pedro plays Joel to a T. And Bella Ramsey has made a believer out of me as Ellie. They changed a little of the story but it works great. I'm 100% happy n excited to finish this. Thank you to everyone working on it you've done what many others before you failed to do. Successfully adapt a video game into a series."

Did I mention I love it!!!???

When I heard the possibility of movies/shows and etc. I was worried and excited. I'm glad they took their time. At first I was not thrilled by the casting, but I've loved Pedro since Narcos, and he's done fantastic things since then as well. Bella is a smaller star but I still wanted to give the benefit of the doubt, they casted everyone for a reason.

I know all the gamer fans had different ideas of the image of the two main characters, but that being said, I was blown away by their performance and am glad they shut my wondering mind down.

People keep adding a summary of the episode...so I'm not going to do that. We don't need to hear it to fill up the minimum characters for a review!

The performance of Bella and Pedro were fantastic! I felt like I was replaying the game for the first time with a new perspective. I loved the added scenes to get the audience who have never experienced the game to get the ""feels"". I had to pause multiple times, telling my girlfriend that this is exactly what they said in the game, or this is even bigger than what they did!

The delivery of Bella's Ellie was awesome, the movement, the tone, the attitude, I loved it. It really shows what a talented actor can do. The actor who played Joel's brother Tommy did a great job, from voice, tone and movement. Joel's Pedro was awesome and Sarah, Joel's daughter was amazing as well.

I don't want to give any spoilers or recap scenes. But once again, as a huge fan of the game, I had chills multiple times throughout the episode. Definitely the best video game adaption I've ever seen, cannot wait to see the full season!"

I hav e never heard of the game, not being a gamer, but I looked at the reviews and saw the extraordinarily high review ratings and immediately thought.... there must be a lot of reviewers associated with the production of this show but I thought I would give it a go anyway. The first 15 minutes of the first episode was very entertaining. BUT. Then I realised it was just another zombie show with very drawn out dialogue to pad the show out. Very little action or drama. Just watched the second episode. More of the same drawn out dialogue and very little action. Except when they kill some more zombies. Definitely wont be wasting any more of my time on this same old garbage."

I wanted to wait till at least after watching the second episode before leaving a review, reason being that I didn't want it to be a case of the first episode being a fluke.

The first episode was brilliant - it had me right on the edge of my seat and engrossed from the moment it started. I was invested in the characters and there was no fault to be placed anywhere.. By the end of the first episode I was definitely left wanting more. I was especially excited to see that Anna Torv from Mind Hunter was in it playing Tess.

The second episode also did not disappoint. The dynamic between Ellie (Ramsey) and Joel (Pascal) is captivating. I am learning also not to get too attached to anyone along the process.

I am definitely in the for the long haul and keen to see how the storyline develops and watch the relationship between Ellie and Joel develop more into a father and daughter type role.

This show is definitely worth a watch.

I hope that they know when to end it though, and don't keep it churning for season after season like The Walking Dead."

If it's going to be almost an hour and a half - you might as well watch a movie lol this is not worth your time unless you love the game apparently.

The setting is fine, might as well be later seasons of TWD. There isn't any notable camerawork, acting or dialogue. It just happens and it's over. Clearly I'm missing something but I'm not about to play an entire video game to become interested in the details or similarities.

The only kind of annoying thing is that they couldn't figure out why the girl was so important.

Excellent, just excellent. I had very high hopes for it and it just delivered. Episode 1 was 81 minutes long but I was on my edge of the seat the whole time. I cried, I laughed. Episode 2, however, was much better than 1. Nail-biting and intense the whole time

The production team really spend a lot of money in this one and it shows. And I always had faith in Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey and they both are just phenomenal acting-wise. Looking forward to see more of Gabriel Luna as he sounded and acted just like Tommy in episode 1

Now let's talk about the haters review bombing this series

Now, I am not saying it's inappropriate to give your opinion. Everyone has a freedom of speech. But if those opinions are targeted at one single person only, I am not okay with it. And that's exactly what's happening here. The 1-5 star ratings are directed only towards Bella Ramsey, who is doing an outstanding job as Ellie

This is directed only towards the haters. Believe it or not, you all are egoistic people. Egoistic because one, Bella being cast as Ellie doesn't satisfy your ego and it never will. Second, the show is rated so good on the review platforms and you can't stand it, so you come and decide to review bomb it to lower the ratings. Go, get a life, haters. If you don't like it and find it boring, just don't watch it, as simple as that."

The race swapping of multiple characters is uncalled for and unacceptable, but somehow thats not even the worst part about the casting. Bella Ramsey has zero resemblance to Ellie's look and voice. Tess is 20 yrs older than she should be, Sarah is black when she was a white blonde girl. Just endlessly bad decisions on casting.

Also Ellie's dialogue has zero resemblance to that of the game. In the game, Ellie was obedient and thankful to Joel and Tess from the start. She was never rude or overly sarcastic. She was cute and innocent, not brash and self-righteous.

The impressive visuals cannot save this garbage. If you never played the game, you will probably enjoy this series, but as someone who played and adored the story of the game, I cannot recommend this."

Episode 1 was a beautiful introduction to the world of the Last Of Us. It was gripping and had its personality while also paying homage to the original video game. (I played both) We meet Ellie near the end of the episode but don't think much of Bella Ramsey's performance because of her short screen time.

And then Episode 2 rolls around...

Immediately in the first scene, we realize that she is an AWFUL Ellie... And there is no sugarcoating it.

Disregarding her lack of resemblance to Ellie... Bella Ramsey's wittiness feels forced and unnatural.

Also, there is no balance of emotions from Ellie. She's portrayed solely as a stuck-up teenager who swears unnecessarily and can't hold a normal conversation without trying to say something witty. There is nowhere to empathize with her.

I fear for this show's longevity if we can't get attached to Ellie this early.

Bella Ramsey was an awful casting for such a crucial role.

Pedro Pascal (Joel) & Anna Torv (Tess), on the other hand, are wonderful.

Hoping I'm wrong as the show progresses..."

The geography, the infected, the characters, the story line, SFX, the utilization of weaponry, the body language and movements of all subjects within this world, the backstory, all of it has to operate together like a well oiled machine for this adaptation to really stick.

They have portrayed Ellie and Joel perfectly going from the clothes and there personalities and there voices, they perfectly casted Ellie and Joel.

As the story progresses in Episode 2, I see nothing surprising. The potty mouthed 14-year old from Episode 1 doesn't stop cursing. Monsters appear sporadically. Lots of walking and such in ruins. Creepy music. Wrecked buildings.

Edit: An entire episode to beardsy gay marriage and euthanasia. And it has nothing to do with the plot, at all. Why?

Permalink";"The last of us is not an impressive show. Everyone says that we finally got a good video game adaptation but I don't know why they're shocked. The last of us is basically just a movie with gameplay in between. Have you ever played a modern PlayStation game before? I think everyone just forgot about how good the first game's story was because part two's was so divisive and for the remake everyone was focused on the price. Still, it is undeniable that the story is very good. Joel and Ellie are good. I have to say though, this is how you adapt a game. As excited as I am for it, the super Mario movie is gonna be nothing like the games because the games have no real story. The last of us lends itself to an easy show. Humans fighting zombies with guns is nothing new effects wise.

Tl;dr of course it's good the game is already basically a show/movie."

Permalink";"So a game that was developed shortly after the walking dead came out and would not have been made had the walking dead not been around, gets a tv show just a few months after the walking dead seemingly and finally finishes (about 8 years overdue), and with the inevitability of countless spinoffs from that show. Poor timing in my opinion

there are so many similarities here.. joel is just like rick for example. The tone is very similar with that southern twang and music, and it's so similar to every zombie apocalypse story out there, of which there have been many many over the past decade or so. The only difference being the fungus element, which is not a big enough detour from the zombie formula

i think we need a break from this type of thing, at least for 5 years or maybe even a decade, then make a last of us show. Maybe."

I just saw it a year ago when this video game will turn into a full TV series, and I just reacted that was Ow! The Walking Dead (Hey, Rick Grimes!), you better get off your way cause TLOU is coming.

I didn't expect how the series began and how the post apocalyptic started in its first episodes. That's how you do it, bro! I think the point here is kind of interesting. No more speculations, no more questoning what was the cause for all of this!

The Last of Us is killing it! Best of luck... I'm a superfan now, by the way."

Pandemic, zombies, military rule.., gosh. Has creativity really ends in that? Contrast this to ""Station Eleven"", which beautifully build a story arch, deep characters and makes you want to know more. This episode made me only wonder when it'll end and whether anything unexpected might happen (which didn't). What puzzles me is the raving reviews. Maybe compared to a video game this series is OK.

I had high expectations after seeing all the skyhigh reviews. And i think the high rating is biased towards the fanbase of the game series.

The first episode is good. But calling it a 10/10 is quite a reach.. On the positive side, we have a game to television adaption that finally seems to be good (Witcher r.i.p) Pedro Pascal Carry the first episode, and is the absolute highlight of the episode.

We learn to bind with his character, trough the most of the first half. And after that, the focus gets more wide.

It ends with the start of a great adventure. And all in all the pilot look very promising. It still has a lot to proove though. And as the series Opens up, the general review will be easier to Settle.

The production budget good Not over the top. But certainly not dissapointing. It could at times remind me a bit of The Walking Dead, with some upped cgi. And great tension.

All in all a positive experience. A recommended watch."

Permalink";"Based on the first episode I rated this 7/10 because it wasn't particularly original but it had intelligent dialogue, mostly excellent performances (except Ellie), solid direction, good use of effects and tight pacing.

Having made it to episode 6 (the last one I plan on watching), I'm constrained to downgrade my assessment. In the episodes since the first, the show didn't get any more original in terms of its premise, but it became significantly odder in its structure. There are long, self-contained stretches that have little to do with the main narrative. That might work in a later season, but the main narrative hasn't been given enough development and doesn't have enough momentum yet to maintain interest during random unrelated interludes. Maybe because there's so much tangential filler away from the central story, the pacing also suffers: it gives the strange impression that the show's both rushing and spinning its wheels."

Clearly, apocalyptic landscapes and ""infection"" films/series are nothing novel and one would roll their wary eyes when reading the synopsis of this series, apparently adapted from a video game. But from the outset, I felt very connected to the characters (the father and daughter in particular). There is something really substantive here in their relationship serving as the catalyst for emotional drama required for a series like this to work.

Permalink";"FINALLY!!! A video game adaptation worthy of seeing! It just goes to show what can happen when you follow the source material, bring on the same people responsible for the success of the game, pour your heart into it, and have the original creator take the helm. Halo (Paramount+) could learn some very valuable lessons from The Last of Us (HBO). Do not walk, RUN to see this show!

*Spoiler Free*

Right from the get-go 'The Last of Us' immerses you into the world you've come to know and love (or will come to know and love). The casting is pretty much perfect, every star has perfectly embodied the spirit of their characters to a ""T"". Nico Parker's portrayal of Sarah is pitch perfect. She acts her heart out in every scene, showing the same witty nature and heart from the video game. Pedro Pascal as Joel is a treat to behold and the expansion on his character, however small, brings a new layer of depth to the character that feels familiar but also new. Gabriel Luna makes for an excellent Tommy, everything from his body language to how he speaks, he is a near crystal copy of the Tommy from the game. Anna Torv makes for an amazing Tess. She's dry, grizzled, and comes across extraordinarily strong. Bella Ramsey perfectly captures Ellie's fiery spirit and strong willed nature, while also eluding to the darker side of her past. And Merle Dandridge makes for a top notch Marlene, from her commanding voice to her soft nature.

Every cast member has poured their heart and soul into their performances, making for a believable world that immerses you into their stories. Fans of the games will be hard pressed to find anything wrong with this show. Though not a 1:1 remake, HBO's The Last of Us expands upon the universe of the game, flushing out the characters and the world in a way that feels fresh and natural. Nothing is out of place, nothing feels wrong, it is the original game amped up to 11. HBO's The Last of Us respects not only the fans of the game, but newer audiences who are just now dipping in their toes for the first time.

And big props go to the creators and crew. Together they brought one of the greatest video games of the past decade to the real world. Every aspect of this show, from the cinematography, the editing, set design, music, special effects - it all perfectly encapsulates the tone and atmosphere from the game, and it all feels real. I'll be honest, I was very skeptical at first when the show was announced, and after the first trailer I approached it with cautious optimism seeing as I am such a huge fan of the game and the trailer looked to stay true to it. And let me tell you, it is worth it. I wonder how scary they'll make it, since sitting alone in a dark room *playing* it is significantly different that *watching* it - that pressure you feel while playing it with the whole ""I have to watch my back, check all the corners, listen to all of the sounds in an environment, etc.,"" is gone, but that allows for other changes to be done with someone watching things unfold instead. Super excited and can't wait for the next ep!

I watched with a friend, but right after I RAN to subscribe to HBO Max because they DESERVE the subscription!!!"

The opening credit is so creative. It shows how the fungus grows and spreads. I can't help but be reminded of the COVID 19 virus as it mutates and spreads. The film genre has mutated. It used to be lorded over by all kinds of zombie stories. Great ones, to be sure, like World War Z, Walking Dead, Black Summer and even Korean films like Train to Busan and Kingdom. Now, we have a deadly fungal infection whose effects on the individual are very similar to those on people who become zombies.

The episode is unsettling as well as thought-provoking. The musical score suitably adds to the gloomy and foreboding tone.

It's a reunion of Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey who starred both in the hit series ""Game of Thrones.""

But other than that, feels like a discount version of The Walking Dead. It's also annoying how they just resort to the typical theatrics and gross factors. I also feel the editing and pacing can be improved. There's cuts in odd places, and the pace is way too slow in some parts and way too fast in other parts. I'll give it another chance and update if it improves, but so far, it doesn't live up to the hype."

It took about half an hour for this episode to actually start following the game, and by that time I was just bored; and when the game finally started happening I just didn't care.

It's incredibly slow with boring predictable characters with zero plot twists or dramatic climaxes whatsoever. I find it unbelievable that a truly mind numbingly dull episode could be rated up there with some of the greats.

It's a sad reflection of the entertainment age we're living in to see something so mediocre be considered so great.

Normally, I will wait for most (if not all) of a season to drop before I begin watching, so that I can get a more immersive experience. The Last of Us may be TOO hair-raising to binge watch, and taking a break between episodes might be a good thing.

The video game that the series was based on was given life by creative director Neil Druckmann, who believed that storytelling had become secondary in the game industry and set out to create a rich narrative in The Last of Us. This source materiel provides a good basis for an action series.

Like ""The Walking Dead"", it takes place in a dystopian America after a fast moving global pandemic has wiped out the vast majority of the population, leaving the corpses reanimated by the parasite disease. The original video game was inspired by a BBC documentary that featured a killer fungi which invades the bodies of ants and can exercise basic control over the insect's motor functions. In the opening scene of the series pilot, an epidemiologist explains that his worst fear is an evolved fungus that is created via global warming.

So: the pilot was crazy good. It grabbed my attention within minutes and reeled me in deeper in every following scene. It appears that HBO spared no expense to bring the world of The Last of Us to life. It's been estimated that each episode costs between 10M and 15M, and the show's budget might even more than Game of Thrones. I can't wait for the next episode."

Whats important with titles like these meaning they have abackground in either books or games etc, is that they follow the source material, and from what i have seen this far they do that perfectly.

And honestly the creator of Chernobyl together with creator of the game working as one? Its just a match made in heaven.

The source material was compelling enough as a video game and the creators of the HBO series (one of whom co-created the game, the other, the hit tv show, Chernobyl) faithfully adapt the story to small-screen audiences while giving gamers much more than a shot for shot remake of their beloved franchise. The acting is on point, especially from the two leads. The suspenseful pacing of the first episode had me sitting up in my seat, hands on my head anxiously watching on as the post-apocalyptic world begins to take shape around Pedro Pascal's tender but fierce, Joel Miller. My hope is HBO execs and the creators don't stretch this out to four seasons and risk becoming the melodrama what was the walking dead. For now it seems they have every intention of doing the story justice."

so, cinematography and editing are lackluster, nothing really stands out
dialogue is repetitive, forced, wayy too much exposition
set design looks and feel gimmicky, fake
action feels weirdly constrained, like it's dead on determined to hit the same beats as the source material without building to it, or letting it be its own thing
sorta rushed, yet drags on. Overall weirdly paced
video-game logic throughout (trust me)


Bruce Straley was the heart of The Last of Us. Since Neil Druckmann forced him out of Naughty Dog, then claimed his Clout and tried to work his magic without Straley's wisdom and realness, Neil have only affirmed since what a lackluster writer he really is.

Oh. And in case I wasn't clear; I dont care too much about this show. It's fan-service, forced theatricals with weird casting and corny directing throughout.

In short; TLOU TV adaptation is like a high-stake episode from season 7 of the Walking Dead with a bit more cash to spare on props, and VFX.

As an avid watcher of that series from the very beginning I cannot be impressed with this. While The Walking Dead lost its way in the later years, the take off from the graphic novels was genius. This series appears to be directed towards those people who either missed watching TWD or were too young to watch. The only good comment I can make is that The Last of Us gives a cause for the ""infection."" I think I'll log on to Paramount+ for a dose of the good old days."

They stayed true to the first game while adding something a little bit more/different which made it a bit of a new experience for those that already know the story while also staying familiar to them. Bella Ramsey as Ellie is perfect, she did such a good job and stole the pilot ep even tho she didn't have much screen time. Pedro Pascal as Joel is also an unbelievable casting, wow he just goes from strength to strength in everything he's in! I'm super excited for the next episode and cannot wait.

It starts very good but the longer the show goes the more negatives you start noticing. While in the original everything happened smoothly and logically, in the TV show too much was taken out of context. So great and fully authentic scenes and dialogues are mixed with poor and empty storytelling, which spoils everything.

Some of the episodes are so empty and feel so unimportant to the main storyline that you can just skip them entirely or the most part of them and won't really feel missing something in the end.

It either feels that the show is trying to follow the primary source very close, but at the same time it doesn't quite catch its soul. If it really did, it would be top notch as the original was."

Ellie is the biggest problem for me, as she comes off too annoying and has none of the innocence and quirkiness from the games, she's just in a bad mood all the time. A little forced.

As for the story in itself, things were way too rushed which gets in the way of caring for the main cast. Let's just wait to see more. Overall 7/10, above average but nothing special."

Permalink";"What a breath of fresh air. I thought The Last Of Us will be drowning under so many amazing zombie show from Korean (Train to Busan, Kingdom, All of us are dead) to the US (Walking dead) etc. But HBO some how float to the top and delivering an emotional, exciting premier.

I've played the game and this series has the same aesthetic feel, the colours, tone, conversation style, building structure and the infection are all true to the game. It's a faithful adaptation, with the story fully flesh out of course, because in the game we only play Joel, here we get to see everyone and the full story.

The premier deliver an informative back story for the main character and introduce us to the world of fungi. The story is engaging, the pacing is great. It gave us enough information then quickly escalate into action, it peaked into an emotional loss then it gave us room to breath and process the grief before going to the next action sequence. They occasionally added humour during an intense confrontation and it works perfectly without ruining the seriousness of the situation.

At first I wasn't convince Bella could carry Ellie's strength and determination, thinking they should have cast someone else. But after watching the premier, i think she did just fine.

Looking forward to Joel and Ellie's adventure."

It's well placed for HBO. Whilst I'd loved to binge the series all at once - because im ready to watch more, I think it's going to mean for the next 8 weeks, Monday will become my favourite day of the week.

If you are thinking, shall I hold off? And wait to watch it when all episodes are out? I'd say get watching it now, before it's too hard to avoid the spoilers on social media.

Can't wait to see for episode 2."

The special effects, story, and acting are all utterly amazing. I was so impressed with the acting talent of even the child actors, especially Joel's daughter. I am unfamiliar with the video-game but the show's premise is interesting. It strikes me as an I AM Legend remake with even better special effects and story than the original blockbuster. I look forward to seeing how this story unfolds. Some of the scenes were scary and emotional. So far so great."

Permalink";"I have to say I'm kind of surprised to see soo much positivty here already in the ratings, it was a positive start, seems to be well produced, good pace and the dark atmosphere is definitly building up while watching it but in the first episode some scenes looked a little bit too staged for me similar like staged scenes in computer games where you later see how you triggered which action, so the whole fleeing scene in the car felt a lot like that. And now I'm coming to my biggest issue which was discussed before, but I'm definitely not happy with the choice of Bella Ramsey for the role of Ellie. Bella is an amazing actress and I loved her role in GoT but she is not a good fit for that role where the cuteness of the girl plays a major role in building up this father daughter relationship later on in the story and to have her as something soo positive against the negativity of the world around them. Seeing Bella tough and not cute at all in the first episode really destroys this part of the story for me and that's a shame because the rest looks really good. I might be wrong and I will edit this review later on after seeing the rest of the episodes but I think the series could have eaaaasily won over way more fans with the right choice for that role. As mentioned before this is no blaming of Bella, she is amazing, but just not in that role :-/. Time will tell."

This show is not good. It's beyond slow. It's boring. I like the guy from the Mandalorian but everyone else has the acting skills of 5th graders in a play. I can't knock the writing because they are following already written material. So the director, most actors, lighting crew, wardrobe and extras all need to bare the responsibility of this disaster.

I wanted to like it. Maybe that's the problem. It disappoints so much it brings out vitriol. There's literally nothing to like. I usually enjoy HBO Show and expected so much more. Sorry.... I do not usually review, but seeing this ranked so absurdly high I just had to. It's just that bad."

I was super excited and scared at the same time for this show to release since I'm a big fan of the games, usually the movies and/or shows are a big let down after.

Not this one, if it continues to go on as strong as it opened this is gonna be a masterpiece that will most likely make me watch it more than once.

I love how the writers took their time with the first episode to really let us know the characters.

For some reason, when I learned they are making a tv show, I didn't even think they could fail. Maybe it's the talent behind the camera, but I knew I could trust them, and I wan not disappointed. The series has been constructed so well, with so many delightful Easter Eggs for a game to notice.

The cast does a great job. Pascal is already a fantastic actor with great charisma and he is the official Joel. Ramsey has the same kick ass energy and they work well together. The setting has the same vibe and look and it is so much fun to see more of the day-to-day life in the city. Every thing looks amazing!

Finally, a game adaptation that has been done with care and thought. I cannot wait to see more, to see Bill. And I cannot wait to play the game again!

Edit: After 3 episode, my opinion still stands. They have made some very smart changes and carefully considered what works for a tv show versus what works for a video game. They handeled Bill and Frank very well and even for a less action oriented episode I enjoyed it a lot.

What comes to the people crying that the show really isn't that good; if you have bad taste, that is your own responsibility. Stop crying and go watch Marvel or Star Wars or what ever generic superhero scifi stuff you like.

EDIT: Now that the show is over, the only negative thing is the lack of clickers. The horror elements, that make the game so awesome, are lacking. Otherwise I still stand behind what I have said. Cannot wait for season 2!!"

The first episode contains a lot of surprises and plot twists. Pascal's character struggles to come to grips with loss and the new framework of society after a zombie apocalypse rips thru the heart of America. He meets a young girl, who may hold the key to human's salvation...

In terms of runtime, fantastic value, the pilot is well over an hour long. May it continue."

This show is so well made and is (mostly) true to the game, even used some of the same quotes as the game. The opening is basically the same, except they added a bit of a backstory for Joel's daughter; which I like, because it gives you a better understanding of how close their relationship is and why Joel changes so much and has a hard time bonding with Ellie at first. I also don't understand the hate towards the cast, I thought they casted the characters perfectly. I especially loved that Marlene's character was played by the same person who voiced the character in the game. And the fact that it's being produced by the creator of the game just makes me certain that this will continue to be a great show. If you haven't played the game and you didn't ""love"" it after the first episode, then wait to watch more before you bash on it, give it a proper chance to impress you or at the least grow on you, as I'm sure it will. I was worried they'd butcher it, TLOF is my absolute favorite video game ever, so I went in with doubts but came out wowed and excited for more."

Please go and see it and you will understand that they made awesome job adapting it on the big screen. They kept the best scenes and the best dialogues and toss everything unecessary.

If there's anyone with any kind of pull, PLEASE do not follow the game for a follow-up season with The Last of Us 2's storyline. It betrays so much of what makes The Last of Us so special, and it will absolutely destroy the series. You have something special right now; it is the talk around the water cooler. We can easily live in this reality for a few seasons. But no matter how much you think TLOU2 needs to be represented, DO NOT DO IT. Just toss that storyline away."

Don't listen to these people, they've obviously never seen the walking dead..

They say ""it's like the walking dead"" about everything that is even remotely post apocalyptic..

If you want some boring arthouse movie or some foreign trash listen to the low reviewers..

Now, here comes The Last of Us and immedietly becomes one of the highest rated TV-Show of all times. Really? How low the industry has fallen if that it's enough to make a decent episode of TV-Show and get Breaking Bad - level ratings just for not screwing up?

No. This is not the greatest TV show in history.

I am a fan of zombie movies and I am not familiar with the source material, a video game. The introduction is not a good as Dawn of the Dead 2004. The characters are not as good as The Walking Dead in the earlier season. The production quality is movie level, not blockbuster, but very high. The introduction upset me with the trope of the character being so incredibly stupid where they keep walking toward and obvious but unknown danger. This is so played out and annoying I almost turned the show off. Once the show gets into the real story, its just the same old scenario done in other stories. I am going to keep watching to see if Pedro Pascal turns to be the same kind of badass hero that Rick Grimes was in Walking dead."

There is a disadvantage to having played the game because you know what happens in general. At the same time, there's the references there for people who have played the game. This show will make you want to play the game, but if you play the game, you'll be spoiled the show. Vice versa.

Since this has been adapted into a TV show, you can compare it to TWD better now. I know for a fact the plots and characters will be much better than TWD. The way they portray the Infected is very different.

The only tiny criticism I have is with the portrayal of Joel. I remember Joel looking more dead and depressed in the game than he has been in the show so far. But Pedro Pascal is a great actor, so this is either a decision by the writers or an oversight.

Apart from the characters and plot, the other big takeaway from the game is the atmosphere and detail in the world, and all of that has been perfectly captured in this episode. Since they're using the source material from the games and the acting has been great so far, I really only see this TV show going up."

A super production with a very heavy cast, so much so that Pedro Pascal who plays Joel and Bella Ramsey, Ellie , worked very well on game of thrones together.

A beautiful direction full of details, which separated the big ( in both directions ) episode 1 , using an interview with an infectologist that brings us up to date on everything to come, then divides the episode into 2 parts, the first being faithfully and extraordinarily occupying the introduction of the game, the sequence inside the car lacks air of apprehensives . With a cinematic language that says a lot between the lines, the characters' own well-defined personality , production design that gives the impression of being dirty in the devastated post-apocalyptic Boston, Music that gives the series a great originality.

Permalink";"To be honest, I don't like watching TV series. Based on the critically acclaimed video game of the same name, the highly anticipated HBO series ""The Last of Us"" is a truly extraordinary viewing experience that will leave you captivated from start to finish. The show deftly adapts the game's powerful storytelling and characters for the small screen, offering an exciting and emotionally charged journey through a post-apocalyptic world devastated by a deadly fungus.

One of the show's greatest strengths is its dedication to character development and emotional depth. Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey give outstanding performances as Joel and Ellie, respectively, and the script does a masterful job of exploring the complex bond that forms between them as they navigate the perils of a fallen society. The series also manages to expand on the game's already affluent world-building and delves deeper into the politics and power struggles of the remaining human settlements.

The series also explores the psychological and emotional effects of the characters, and viewers can see the gradual change in the characters throughout the series. The script is well written and leaves a lasting impression on the audience. The pace of the series is also well done and keeps the audience engaged throughout the show.

Overall, ""The Last of Us"" is a must-see for fans and newcomers alike. The series manages to stand on its own as masterful storytelling while also staying true to the source material. An exciting and ultimately hopeful tale of survival and humanity in the face of unimaginable horror that will leave you stunned.

It's the storytelling, powerful performances and intense atmosphere that will captivate you and set it apart as an unforgettable watch. The series also raises thought-provoking questions about the nature of humanity and the distances we will travel to survive. It's a show that you will remember long after you finish watching it. Please go on."

Even that I didn't know anything of this original game, it was a marvelous start of a trip through america after their unavoidable apocalypse....actors, cinema, direction, the storytelling. It is all of very high standard. We know that for a few years from al lot of productions from Netflix, Amazon prime, disney+, but HBO is the only capable to make something that is not only good, it is really great cinema.... Can't wait for the rest of this serie. Thanks."

Permalink";"The only reason The Last of Us has even come close to sniffing a 9+ rating on IMDB is because of Video Game fans. This is by no means intended as a critique to VG fans - I am one of them. I've never played The Last of Us, but I have heard it's an amazing piece of art, and I do hope to play it some day.

All that said, this is just not good.

I've managed to force myself through the first 25 minutes of the first episode, right up until the gang's initial escape from the city. So far, I've concluded the following:

1) The dialogue is painfully subpar. Full of tropes, cliches, witty one-liners trying to establish a relationship between the father and the daughter, on-the-nose expositional one-liners that make me roll my eyes every time someone opens their mouth, the video-game dialogue catering to the video-game audience (in the car, ""Straight, road, embankment, turn left, turn right, median, shoulder."")

2) The scene with the -spoiler- twitching in the background freaked me out, very well done.

3) Three? There is no three, I haven't gotten that far. Whoever enjoys the show, kudos! It just wasn't my giant-ass-bucket of tepid, diluted tea."

She was trying too hard to be an unlikeable spoilt kid. I ve never played the game but I sat and thought, here we go again, she's probably going to be the cure and they have to get her to the experts with a lot of hassle, like it hasn't been done many many times before, even on a simpsons episode. Pedro Pascal does a great job of keeping the viewer interested, but Bella ruins it with her sour expressions. I m left wondering how it got such a high score, are gamers really that easily entertained with a tv show? I suppose what they do is very repetitive so that explains it."

The story progresses quickly enough to keep you intrigued but without skipping anything important or being jarring. It's hard to capture my attention without extreme witty banter and this did it. It has enough heart, enough grit, enough drama, fantastic crew and the writing is real, engaging and well thought out.

Pascal dominates the screen from the get go. His portrayal of Joel is spot on. The production is gritty but not so over the top that it's fantasy like. It still has a very grounded feeling throughout the episode. The supporting cast is fantastic. Each very clear in their role. The pacing was perfect and not too much time was spent developing any particular scene. It just moves along and tells the story. I was completely locked in."

The acting is great, the story is on point, and everything else fits so well. I really hope HBO doesn't do what other shows have done and intereject their own bias and opinions to fit the narrative of an exisiting story to meet some arbitrary need to change it for the sake of change. However, the show isn't a 1:1, and there have been some minor changes in the story but they aren't that big an issue due to their great writing and accurate story telling."

Permalink";"As a massive fan of TLOU games, I was very excited for this, though the casting choices made me scratch my head based on appearances alone. However, most of the cast have proven themselves very capable thus far.

Bella Ramsey and Nico Parker, who play Ellie and Sarah respectively, despite not looking anything like the original characters, absolutely knocked it out of the park and nailed the roles. Bella's performance makes me hopeful for the rest of the series.

The main outlier and main concern of mine so far is, surprisingly, Pedro Pascal. Pedro's performance as Oberyn Martell in Game of Thrones was fantastic, and he quickly became one of my favourite characters. However, his performance as Joel seems to be a little lacklustre, or perhaps miscast.

Joel Miller is a very nuanced character; an extremely vulnerable and broken man who developed a stoic/hardened/detatched/bitter front after his tragic loss. I am not feeling that level of depth from Pedro's performance... so far he just seems a little reserved and aggressive.

*That* opening scene in TLOU game made me extremely emotional to the point of tears in every playthrough. The TV version felt underwhelming by comparison, outside of Nico's incredible performance.

I'm excited to watch the rest of this series, but I do hope Pedro leans more into the role of Joel as the show progresses. Also to the reviewers insulting gamers for their passion for video games, please try to develop a prefrontal cortex at some point in your lives."

Permalink";"As ""The Last of US"" (2022 release; 9 episodes) opens, it is ""1968"" and a guest on a TV talk show discusses pending doom and gloom from a fungus-related pandemic that is sure to come. We then go to ""September 26, 2003, Austin, TX"" and we are introduced to Joel and his teenage daughter Sarah. It's not long before stranger things start to happen... At this point we are 10 minutes into Episode 1.

Couple of comments: this TV mini-series adaptation of the PlayStation video game of the same name is the brainchild of. Craig Mazin, whose previous work includes the excellent TV mini-series ""Chernobyl"". Let me state upfront that I was completely unfamiliar with the video game, let alone playing it. I came to Episode 1 (which runs 80 min.) completely open-minded about was about to unfold. The series is super plot-heavy, so the less said about that, the better. I will say this that I found Episode 1 riveting and at times very intense (reminding me of the opening scenes of ""World War Z""). I was quite impressed with the production set, and it feels like a major Hollywood production, even though it was filmed entirely in Canada.

""The Last of Us"" premiered on HBO and HBO Max a few days ago. New episodes will be released on Sunday evenings. If you are in the mood for a top notch zombie-ish action-drama, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion. I for one cannot wait to check out the remaining episodes!

*UPDATE* Just saw the second episode. It just confirms all the good I saw before, and I'm looking forward to seeing the next episodes."

Permalink";"I still can't get used to the fact that this masterpiece now becomes a show... at times I thought it was a cutscene and because I was watching it on a ps4 everything intensified even more.

That's not necessarily a good thing for the show to look so much like the game, more specifically in technical terms; directing, script, editing, photography... simply because this exhibition format is not so practical when it comes to a movie and in this case a show.

TLOU is already cinematic, it's a blockbuster transcribed into a game, so an adaptation asks for more context, or background, in the script to fill the lack of immersion that is clearly not going to be the same and that in a game is much easier to achieve. So we have longer scenes, another point of view for the same story, and that's not necessarily, or entirely, creative freedom, although yeah, there is a lot of creative freedom in this first episode. My point is that everything that happened in this episode, more context or truly something new, is all done to bring us closer to this world/characters. But for me, this show ended up not being able to do that, it couldn't bring me as close as I would have liked to this universe, especially these characters.

There's something, I can't say exactly what, that made it impossible for that to happen.

I can't say if it was the strangeness of seeing these people that for almost 11 years I've known so well in an adapted way and so standardized as characters in a post-apocalyptic story, and not exactly something you see in the game, people, not characters. (As I said, many years with these people, it's strange to see them acting as characters.)

I've had a really long journey with The Last of Us, this story, these people, this game has helped me in so many ways; it enabled me to deal better with who I was, and was trying to be. I just wish I had loved it, not just liked it, which is what happened.

In short, it was good, I can see that."

One could say that, that's a good for a adaptation, because alot of the video game adaptation don't get done justice, or they float to much away from the source material, to the point of where it's no longer recognizable and its own new thing.

This one was magnificent-pulling you in from the very first scene where the Fungus Specialists are speaking.

(Interestingly- our entire global eco system is based on fungus.)

It had drama, tension-some really poignant moments- and left me looking forward to the next episode with a passion not felt since the Game of Thrones.

Not that it's a similar story-but it's captured my imagination fully.

After The Banshee of Inisherin- I was bit cautious as the hype encouraged me to watch a ghastly film.

This series cannot be hyped enough to do it justice, in my opinion.

The cast-the scenes- the cohesive story with glimpses/suggestions of classic sci-fi books I read years ago.

The music codes- looking forward to hearing more of them.

I'd give it 20 stars if I could."

I loved him in got but come on, I've seen the ""little"" girl in other shows including got (which she was great in) but I guess all I can put it back to is when they remake or make something from a game or book it very seldom lives up to the original, sadly the same here. Why don't they just make new original stuff rather than ruining games and books or comics or original films. Also so tired of blabbing mouths, whatever your opinion is fine, but this is mine and I'm allowed it. I'm sure people who didn't play the game will like it, so good for you. This is a pass for us. Also Bella's accent comes through a LOT so another sloppy attempt at casting (how could she have an English or Scottish accent in 20 years??)"

The cast are amazing and do a great job acting for those who have doubts. Yes Bella may not look exactly like Ellie but she definitely is Ellie. Yes some characters seem different in the show compared to the game but this isn't supposed to be a carbon copy. It's an adaptation which appeals to everyone equally not just for us gamers. Amazing cinematography and story that I believe to be better and expands upon the game in such a unique way. Pedro may have bad knees and not crouch as much and spores aren't really seen, but that's because of filming restrictions & personal restrictions. Don't let the minor things take away from the big picture and heart and soul of this series because it still captures the essence of the game and a Rollercoaster of emotions!"

The prologue of 'When Your Lost in the Darkness"" had me shouting at my screen in excitement. They absolutely hit the nail on the head when talking about the effects of a fungal pandemic, followed by a spectacular title sequence.

However, aside from the title sequence, this show was lacking in terms of visual effects. The use of green screen was so incredibly obvious and the lighting came off as amateur. They really should've used an LED volume and a different lighting company.

The CGI animation of the infected had its highs and lows. The sudden upwards jolt of their head comes off as incredibly corny, while the running, jumping, and stumbling shots felt truly impressive.

Bella Ramsey on the other hand was a complete miss for the part of Ellie. Even the performance of seasoned Pedro Pascal felt like rehearsal during his exchanges with Bella. This really goes to show how important casting is and how it effects the entire mood of the show, cast, and set.

The story telling could've been better. At times it felt like the writers of this show chose to shoot the least interesting perspectives of the entire situation for what I could only guess to be a cut in cost. I would've liked for them to have jumped around a little more to offer the unfamiliar viewer some character development."

People are making a fuss about the casting, I'm not a big fan of the game series so maybe that's why it's easier for me to say it, but I believe that just because Ramsey is not a hot looking chick is not enough reason for criticizing this show, I think she will prove everyone wrong because she is a talented wonderful actor, she should just stop listening to others and focus on her path, so for one thing be happy your favorite character is in her capable hands, the only thing that can ruin this show is if they change the story into a cheesy adaptation only for commercial goals .

Bella Ramsey does a great job of portraying the character. (I was a skeptic about this earlier). But one thing. Ellie's character in the game is quite a quiet, self-contained person. (I saw it that way). After meeting Joel, she shows emotions, sharpness, fun, jokes. In the second part, she is generally completely alone and withdrawn into herself. Introvert. In the film, Ellie is initially shown as self-sufficient, blunt, and a bit of an anarchist. And this is very correct! The film has a more emotionally correct character. Considering in what world these children were born. But I like Ellie from the game more)"

Permalink";"This has been a show that I've long-awaited for as I'm sure so many other fans of Naughty Dog's 2013 game 'The Last of Us' and its 2020 sequel, 'The Last of Us Part II' have been. And let me say, the wait was absolutely worth it after only seeing the first episode. From the casting of Joel and Ellie to the shots that are so beautifully adapted and replicated from the games, this show has shown it's worth and ability to not disappoint. Pedro Pascal, an absolutely perfect choice for the role of Joel. Bella Ramsey, as an actress that I am not familiar with yet she has done an amazing job portraying the role of Ellie. Nico Parker, Gabriel Luna, Anna Torv, all amazing in crafting their own versions of these beloved characters of Sarah, Tommy, and Tess. Needless to say, I am more than excited for what is to come in future episodes of HBO's 'The Last of Us'."

What nice explanations of what happens to the characters that wasn't explained in the game. I liked the Cold Open the best.

I had my doubts with Bella Ramsey, but she plays the part so believably.

That Marlene is played by the same actress as in the game I find absolutely Gödde class.

I think it's great that the first episode wasn't primarily about the clickers, but wanted to show it's a drama in the post-apocalypse.

The music by Gustavo, which also accompanied the game, is a treat that should not be missed. I hope the man gets a Grammy for this performance. I bet my ass that the series will win at the next golden globes."

It was a good first episode, lots of explanation and the parallels were very fun to see.

I'm excited to see where this show goes. The visuals are great, the mood fits for a post-apocalypse world and the backstory added to the depth of the characters. I truly think this show has earned the attention it's garnered and will continue to with each episode that is released.

If you want something captivating, more interesting than the Walking Dead, and an incredibly sweet ode to the game it comes from, this is the show for you."

Not sure what all the hype is about. I think a lot of people will watch it for a season or two then fire of it just like other zombie post-apocalytic shows. The characters seem interesting from the 1st episode but again, nothing new here from what I've seen. Seems like they'll be traveling across America battling infected humans while getting to know each other. Doesn't seem all that exciting to be honest. I think this show will fizzle out fast."

The introduction clarified the situation and highlighted the unique problems each person faced. I'm particularly interested in watching how they create the characters, grow the connections, and make an effort to mimic the gameplay.

I can't wait to see the rest of the series. Zombie TV shows and films have been done countless times before and frequently lack creativity, but this so far has been a breath of fresh air. If it focuses on human emotion and connection like the games do, it'll do incredibly well."
"10/10";"BEST ADAPTATION OF A VIDEO GAME";"rexmatthewj";"18 January 2023";"42 out of 96 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.
Permalink";"The HBO series ""The Last of Us"" is a highly-anticipated adaptation of the critically acclaimed video game of the same name, The Story follows the journey of Joel And Ellie as they navigate a world ravaged by a deadly fungus that has turned most of humanity into zombie-like creatures.

One of the most striking aspects of the series is its tone. The show manages to balance moments of intense action and suspense with quieter, more introspective scenes that allow the audience to get to know the characters and understand their motivations. The theme is primarily focused on survival, loss, and the bonds between the two main characters, Joel and Ellie. The acting is top-notch, with leads Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey delivering powerful performances that will leave a lasting impression.

The Direction and Cinematography are also noteworthy. The series has a distinct visual style that perfectly captures the desolate and dangerous world the characters inhabit. Production Design and Special effects are also used to great effect, making the series feel both realistic and fantastical. The Score Composed By Gustavo Santaolalla, adds to the emotional impact of the series, heightening the tension and drama.

The Pacing of the series is well-done, with each episode building on the last to create a satisfying and cohesive narrative. The dialogue is well-written and believable, adding depth to the characters and their relationships.

Overall, The Last of Us is a gripping and emotional series that will leave a lasting impact on its audience. Its a must-watch for fans of the game and newcomers alike. The Series has resonated with me in a way that i didn't expect it to and it has left deep emotional impact on me."

We have yet to see more episodes of it, but it already might be the best game-to-series translation we will witness considering how amazing the story and actual atmosphere of the Last of Us is.

HBO nailed it with a cast that resembles the characters of the original and tells the story without it to much feeling like a copy of the original script. Allowing the creator of another all time high, Chernobyl, to set the scene might be the best option there is for this story.

I had to recover from the Last of Us game ending and am already exited, yet also afraid, for a similar feeling in HBO's translation of this absolute masterpiece."

Permalink";"The show deviates from the game a bit here and there but stays true to the emotional core of the game; nails the atmosphere, tone of the world, as well as acting and tensions of a post-pandemic zombie world. It also sets up the whole journey they're about to take and explains the rival factions fairly well in the world. Joel and Ellie are perfect so far. There's less action than in the game (wanna see Joel crouch for 30 minutes and throwing bottles at dudes heads on tv? Lol) but that gives the characters more moments to further explore and create more character depth.

It's only 1 episode but this is better than all TV video game adaptations by far and looks like amazing tv series overall (too soon to say better than most TV series? I don't think so). Definitely better than the Witcher by a mile. This is really gonna make executives and producers of upcoming video game adaptations pay attention. The bar is being set very high for them."

I get both sides tbh but the side I'm listening too is the side that haven't played the game and from what I can seen amongst the super high and overly marked 10s and the unnecessary 1s Is the few 6,7,8 and I think that's the true ""score "" is .

For the first time there is an adaptation with creators and writers that actually listened and thought: the game is so great why change it. Not that i'm saying they have to keep everything the same way (except for the casting, also awesome job). But they absolutely nailed it. I cannot wait to not be productive again so i can keep watching. Thank you HBO."

Beautiful cinematography, wonderful storytelling and brilliant acting. I cannot say much about the story since I do not know anything except for the pilot I have watched. It seems to be a story with a lot of other levels that will open up and intervene in the coming episodes. It might struck one as any other post doomsday scenario though. Somehow it also reminded me of Stranger Things in that it started in 1968 and ended with a beautiful Depeche Mode song. It also reminded me of Hot Skull. Still, it would be too soon to doom it like that. I believe this story has a great potential. I hate starting a series that is airing weekly because waiting is just a real pain. So let the watch for the next episode start."

Absolutely brilliant. The start of the show also gives you a partial back story of how the 2 main characters are gonna be intertwined through out. Emotionally heavily involved from the very start. Also it does seem as though its gonna stick predominantly to the game play lineage, but hopefully with a few creative writing twists. May be some extremely exciting surprises through out. Can't wait for the next episode."

Permalink";"A video game adaptation worthy of seeing! It just goes to show what can happen when you follow the source material, bring on the same people responsible for the success of the game, pour your heart into it, and have the original creator take the helm.

Big props go to the creators and crew. Together they brought one of the greatest video games of the past decade to the real world. Every aspect of this show, from the cinematography, the editing, set design, music, special effects - it all perfectly encapsulates the tone and atmosphere from the game, and it all feels real. There is no shortage of excellence in this season opener from any department or performer. Craig Mazin (Chernobyl) and Neil Druckmann have created great television that not only honors its video game predecessor, but dives deeper into the world it created. Episode 1 with an hour and a half run time has set the tone for a series that I am very compelled to watch. This is first rate storytelling television. 9/10.

20 years after a pandemic has radically changed known civilization, infected humans run wild and survivors are killing each other for food, weapons; whatever they can get their hands on. Joel, a violent survivor, is hired to smuggle a 14 year-old girl, Ellie, out of an oppressive military quarantine zone, but what starts as a small job soon transforms into a brutal journey across the U. S."

I was very much wrong. I knew that no matter what Pedro Pascal would knock it out of the park playing Joel, but I thought that the script would let him down and do the game injustice like the halo tv series. To my surprise it was absolutely fantastic, the visuals, the story beats along with almost a 1 for 1 sequence from the game. I loved the game and this does a fantastic job at showing it off. Absolutely brilliant in all ways. As I said the story beats were spot on, not rushed really getting to know the characters but moving on at the right times. The Cinematography to the sound design is extremely impressive and close to the game. I don't have anything bad to say about it. One of the best game adaptations to come in resent year."

I love this first episode. It's not like the walking dead or other zombie series at all. But it is still in a modern apocalypse setting.

Make sense what happend in the beginning of the show. They did a good job showing what was going on before the actual show started, Nice to see Game of Thrones actors Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Elle (Bella Ramsey) again. She (Bella) growed as a actor, although still young.

I'm certainly curious to see what happens next and how Joel reacts to this cheeky new girl in his life. I don't know the games so i've know idea how the story is going to be and now I've to wait for it a week! No bingewatching."

From the very start you are captured and involved, i was most impressed by how much like the game it is, even the camera angles panning felt like you were in the game, during the scene where they are driving through the ongoing chaos it feels like you are there. It takes something special to get you emotional after 30 minutes aswell. I hope they can keep to how much like the game it is and i look forward to that.

They nailed the story and the time line but it doesn't feel the same way as the game . They missed the creepy elements and the scary feeling. As soon as you start playing the game you get creeped out by the way it is . The show did not do that for me . For example, the holes in the building was not there and they did not make the fedra Guys scary as they should be . They focused too much on character development but that's not what the last of us game is about . I played the game over 10 times and I can tell you the characters were kind of hopeless and doomed in the beginning but slowly builds on you. The games brought the creepy , scary , dark feeling of doom and terror in the beginning that made you want to navigate through but after you play it a while you're like yea it's not scary anymore but you keep going because you're now into the characters. The show wants you to be into the characters from the beginning and fails to bring the other elements out. Not sure if what I wrote made sense but if you played the game like me you'd understand where I'm coming from . Overall I'd give this episode a 7 out of 10 because it's the first episode, hopefully we get those missing elements in the upcoming episodes. ."

From the moment the camera comes in on Hannah for the tone setting dialog, you'll be hooked, with Nico Parker delivering a performance her famous mother would be proud of.

Anna Torv delivers an equally strong performance, equal and better of her show leading turn on Fringe.

Then there's Pedro Pascal, delivering an emotionally nuanced performance that hits all the right notes for a character that we soon believe is capable of almost anything in the name of survival.

Episode One is more like watching the first half of a major motion picture then it is a TV show, only it's done to a far higher standard then all but the highest budget films.

It blew me away how creative and faithful they were to the source material at the same time. For example, the way you start the video game playing as Sarah and how it feels walking around your house alone was captured perfectly even though they made tweaks! Even more impressive was that the tweaks only served to help preserve the elements of surprise from the video game, so these ""tweaks"" actually made you feel closer to what you felt during the video game then if it had just been a shot for shot copy. This really sets the new standard for greatness when it comes to adaptations and due to it standing head and shoulders above anything I have seen before.

I can see from the Pilot that this show will run in a way that will always please me as a viewer, as I really like the way they are trying to recreate many shots from the game.

However, if this show had 3 episodes and all of them were in this same pace and action, I would give it a 7. This episode is lacking in engagement, we need to get stuck to the screen. In games, you can shot lighter scenes, we do not need many things to happen at once. Because we are playing, and we are focused. In a show, more movement and action is needed, more things happening at the same time.

If we get that in the next episodes... Oh boy, this will be epic. Cast is top class, story is top class."

I also think for the main part they have done a great job of casting with my only exception for Bella Ramsey as Ellie. I didn't like her in Game of Thrones and find her a little irritating with the way she performs but it's early days and hopefully she can prove me wrong.

Solid opening episode and having Neil Druckmann on board will help keep it true to the game series. Buckle in for the highs and lows this series will give.

The casting is phenomenal, Pedro Pascal is the perfect mix of Joel's grit, determination and all-out 'badassery' with the excellent facial, vocal, visual and emotional acting that we have come to expect from Pedro.

Bella Ramsay is a 1:1 ratio for what I would expect from Ellie if she were a real person. Her demeanour, style, expressions and not to mention her incredible likeness not just visually but also vocally in comparison to Ellie from the games is uncanny.

Supporting actors were also very well cast and portrayed, particularly Sarah's casting - executed perfectly, right up to the climax all of us game fans were waiting for.

I could not have asked for anything different, the writing was incredible, with many lines pulled directly from the game script along with some of the cinematography and set pieces. With additional scenes, ideas and more making the show a brilliant watch both for die-hard TLOU fans as well as those who have never played the games.

I cannot wait for the rest of the season and my only complaint is that I cannot watch it all at once.

As a final note - Gustavo has done an amazing job as always on the music and HBO have followed this up with a title screen that tops the game's!"

After watching episode 1 of The last of Us, I can tell you that it's definitely not the case with this one. I love the games and they were dedicated to the source material.

The prologue of the game was the most tense, cinematic and emotional gut punch I have ever experienced in a video game EVER. This show, in episode 1, completely and totally NAILED IT. All the intensity, anticipation and emotion came flooding back during the adaptation's prologue (so much so, my wife asked me if I was alright...LOL)!

The casting, although not perfect, was very good. The cinematography and dialogue translation from the game was excellent. I really don't have much to complain about and am totally stoked to see if they maintain the storyline from the source material.

Permalink";"The show kept everything from the game while adding a level of cinematic satisfaction to every second of it. Pedro Pascal does an amazing job as Joel. His performance is convincing and layered I can't wait to see how he dives into other parts of Joel's journey. Gabriel Luna steals the show in every scene he's in, Tommy is maybe one of the closest to the game.

And Bella Ramsey kills it as Ellie, Her performance is perhaps one of the best you'll ever come across.

The direction and writing is at high level as it can get, scenes feel engaging even when little action is happening and characters feel familiar even at first sight... the writers captured the tone perfectly and the set design implements that very tone to every scene.

To sum it all up, HBO's The Last of Us is an outstanding piece of television which stays true to its source. PERFECTION!"

Permalink";"Some reviews define the TV series as hackneyed because of zombies. Why are they wrong?

Cause this show is not about the apocalypse at all.

The episode is absolutely wonderful, just like this whole universe. Is there something here that distinguishes it from other zombie apocalypses? In my opinion, there is. This is a fungus that is taken from the real world, which to a certain extent really inspires horror. Any other movie, including The Walking Dead, is much less believable.

There is no main character here, as in other TV series, who gathers his factions, tries to lead everything, be a leader, save everyone's life.

This is a story about a very ordinary man whose daughter died. About a man who is not a scumbag, but feels almost no emotions. About his relationship with the same ordinary child.

Yes, the story is not new, because the game was shot and because there are other zombie movies. But is that a problem?

After all, the meaning of this story is not in zombies at all, but in the most ordinary people that we ourselves would become in such conditions.

Having watched a bunch of zombie movies, I have never felt such an atmosphere, inspiring horror and despair, as after the first series of The Last of Us (even in the game itself, I did not feel this :)).

In addition, it is immediately felt that the film was shot with great love and respect for the franchise. A great selection of actors, the music is fascinating.

New explanations that were not in the game. Very deep characters.

I repeat, this is not a Game of Thrones, where every second is trying to lead an army. And this is not a new universe. This is our theoretical reality, where the government has been preserved, but tightened. Where danger is not always zombies. Where humanity has practically disappeared. Where people don't live, but exist.

And you feel all this right after watching the first episode.

Absolutely wonderful."

I immediately got lost in the perfect implementation of game and series.

Perfect cast , beautiful camera and picture work.. atmosphere on point.

It's the best first episode from a series since Chernobyl.

I'm really curious about the next episode and can't wait for the next week.

I can smell a masterwork and Top 5 series of all time here !

If they manage to show the connection between Ellie and Joel like in the game I will totally fall in love with this series.

It's the biggest potential a series ever had and with Chernobyl the producer already made a must watch.

This will be his second big thing."

Really well written. Atmosphere is phenomenal. It's building up slowly but it is never dull in any moment.

I am really happy there are no exposition moments for ""today's audience"". The show let's you sink into the gritty and believable reality it portrays.

From the first segment until the last scene with the, a masterful choice of song, it grips you by the guts and twists them.

I like that nothing is telegraphed. The emotions, acting, motivations of characters, surrounding, all look very convincing and believable.

Let's hope everything stays on that track."

I've read some reactions about the casting and the typical backlash about diversity and whatnot, and frankly I couldn't care less about who portrays the character as long as they're good actors and these are very good actors. The story is also very well written which helps those actors a good bit. There are a couple jumps in time to setup the story but that's it so far. There's no convoluted back and forth like some series get bogged down with and the story moves quickly and does a nice job of weaving new characters and situations in for the main characters. The production is top notch, as is expected from most HBO dramas and it looks and feels like a major motion picture. There are some scenes of gore since the virus this is about basically turns humans into zombies but it's more in the background so far, which puts the story squarely on the current situation people find themselves in which involves totalitarian government and a resistance. Looking forward to the rest of the season!"

I catch myself singing the main theme of the game just walking around. And now a new series tries to work with the very same melody? Is the show allowed to do this? Yes it is. The show adds perfect background knowledge to the story and is not changing cruel plot points. This is perfect, because you don't feel like you are just watching the let's play again but with different faces. It gives it another layer but stays faithful to its original storyline.

Only the dialogues I sometimes found a little bit silly. Maybe that's just me but apart from that, music, pacing, cinematography and acting is on a very high level. Can't wait for the next episode."

For starters I know how hard we all are on video game adaptations in movies and in TV, but I must say that The Last Of Us Tv show has so far nailed it in my books.

The show is on point, there are so many references to the game and in its acuracy during EP 1 where SCENE from SCENE was shot in perfection and in complete sync (the car scene with Joel and his daughter in the game).

This shows us that in fact not ALL game adaptations are bad.

Pedro Pascal plays a brillant Joel, his emotion and overall concept of Joel is SPOT ON, he truly makes me excited to see where this show goes.

Bella Does a fantastic job representing Ellie. I was a bit aprehensive about how she would play out, since Ellie is so important to a lot of us, but ill say that she nailed it out the park.

Often times in the episode I almost thought I was back playing The Last Of Us Part 1 on PS4. She sounded SO much like the Ellie we all know and Love.

Great start to the series I cannot wait for episode 2!"

Expands on many story aspects from the get go. The world itself and character building are brilliant and kind of makes me wish a lot of this was injected into the game.

But this is where we get to see the the full scope of what druckman imagined.

I would say the first episode is purely just an introduction and sets the stage for the next 8 episodes. The infected are fast and aggressive, reminds me a little of world war Z which makes them terrifying.

I had high expectations for the show and thought they would struggle to hit them. I was wrong, completely wrong. Im kind of happy the weekly episode routine is back but i feel i could binge the whole season in one sitting.

The middle section is good and paced well to provide enough information going forward as to the objective the players and whats happened to the world outside.

Zombie TV shows and films have been done millions of times before and often lack creativity but this so far has a breath of fresh air and if like the games concentrates on human emotion and connection then I think it'll do incredibly well and I can't wait to watch the rest of the series."

I feel like this show takes what the walking dead did and improves on it in almost every way. If you're a fan of that show or any dystopian/post-apocalyptic type of story, you'll easily put this show in your top 10 list.

I've seen pretty much every video game adaptation whether it be movies, tv shows, or even books, and nothing comes close to how well this was done. Let this be a lesson to the writers of The Witcher series that straying too far from source material is a surefire way to produce a crap product. The casting in TLOU is amazing, Bella completely blew my expectations out of the water, Pedro is quite simply put, perfect, for the role of Joel, Gabriel Luna as Tommy is eerily similar to his character in the game......like his voice sounds almost exactly like Tommy!!!

I'm a fan of Pedro Pascal & his work. He's been brilliant in almost everything I've watched of his. I typically look forward to content he's a part of.

At this stage I must admit I've played the game. Infact it was the very reason I bought the PS4 just so I could play the Last of Us. I absolutely loved the game. The character designs & voice acting were near perfect. Same could be said for other Naughty Dog games.

When I first saw the trailer & the casting choices, my initial feeling was that Pedro is not a 'Joel' & Ramsey is not an 'Ellie' I was still willing to give the live action a shot to see if my mind would change.

After the first episode it hasn't, it's not just Ellie & Joel actor choices but the other main story characters too. I don't have that same connection to Tommy as I did in game either. Marlene is probably the only choice that doesn't suck.

Just like Uncharted the movie, they got the casting wrong. The actors they chose are not bad actors but they just don't fit the character profile.

Please reconsider your casting director/choices for your other projects."

Great start to the journey and a good introduction to people who haven't played the game. I've played it several times and it's easily in my top 3 of all times.

Some reviews here will complain about the actors/actresses not looking like the characters from the game. And that some things have been changed from the game. A few complain about the pacing feeling slow as well.

If you want the game then go play the game. If you just want the exact story from the game, then go to youtube and find a video of all the cut scenes from the game. And if you have the attention span of a goldfish, then this might be beyond you.

This however, is absolutely amazing.

Yes, non of the characters are animated, so they do look different. And they have made changes to the way the story is told. But only what was necessary to tell the story in this format. If anything, I think the changes so far have improved the story.

A great story made even better."

That doesn't mean you have to know the games in order to enjoy this. They transferred the story from one medium to another amazingly well, so all the details are there, just make sure you pay attention. Also, this is a end-of-the-world zombie show, but it isn't about zombies. The apocalypse is the backdrop to what is/will be one of the most emotional and beautiful stories ever told in entertainment.

I know I sound like I'm exaggerating, but I can't describe how happy I am with what they managed to do here.

Finally, the first episode is great, both Bella and Pedro are literally like watching the video game characters come to life (same goes for all other ones, too), but I also have to give special mention to Nico Parker, the actress that plays Sarah, I really feel like she stole the show in the first episode.

Cannot praise HBO enough here as lately there has been to many disappointments but HBO most of the time deliver a movie feel to a series format that the rest can't get close too.

Even without having played the game, you will feel instantly drawn into this horrific turn of events where our world is a disaster obliterated by a Fungus which can absolutely decimate the human race. Funny enough this fungus exists in the real world but only in ants so don't cac yourself just yet.

The opening monologue was brilliant, the first 20 mins were epic, then it settles and the name of the game is surviving day to day. This is more about human relationships and not just about scary monsters, this is not just for horror fans although if you are a bit squimish then this may not be for you but otherwise this looks to be a brilliant start. Hopefully each episode continues in the same vain because the world looks and feels right, sound and cinematography is spot on and the acting believable. Bring on EP2!"

Permalink";"Just came out of my second watch, of the first episode, on Neon, and, as a gamer, I thought I'd put up a review.

Well, firstly, Pedro makes a convincing Joel - when I first heard the casting, I thought well, Pedro, yeah, he could pull it off - my idea of the perfect Joel would be someone like Kris Kristofferson, or even Tom Berenger - maybe Tom for Joel and Kris for Tommy. Anyways, I thought, yeah, Pedro could pull it off and since being a GOT fan, I figured, yeah, let's see what he's got.

For Bella Ramsey, on the other hand, I wasn't initially convinced - I did like her in GOT for being a feisty little package but, for Ellie, in The Last of Us, I wasn't entirely sold. I think this was mostly due to having played the games and being aware that Ellie, for the first iteration of The Last of Us, was supposedly originally partly modeled after the then actress Ellen Page - there is a whole history to this and how Ellie has developed over the years so hence the announcement for Bella Ramsey left me with misgivings but who else would they cast, indeed, to portray Ellie at the age of the timeline?

Anyway, having played the three games, The Last of Us, The Last of Us: Left Behind, a sort of part origin prequel, part filler, to The Last of Us, and the brutal Last of Us II, I have been nonetheless waiting, with excitement, for the HBO show release.

So, from a gamer's perspective, first impressions were very positive. I just like to say that I am totally impressed with the effort and lengths the production team has gone to, to bring the vibe and feel of the game, to the screen. Main things I noticed, right off the bat, were the main colour palette, saturation, depth and fields of view, certain camera shots, all brought the game feeling to the screen and when I heard that opening theme and I knew it was Gustav Santaolalla's music, well it was so eerie and a lot of emotion from the games came flooding back.

They even used the same font, from the game, for the show title, hahaha - awesome.

First off, clearly they will do some stuff different as that's just the way it is, with adaptations but, so far, their commitment to the game deserves applause.

Am not gonna talk about the plot or anything, just excited to be here, for what seems to be a great start.

I think Bella will grow on me - for a game, Ellie is a very deep and multi-faceted character, perhaps more so than Joel, and so far, at this point, I'm willing to stick with it and give it a shot.

Great to see Australian actress Anna Torv too, by the way - have liked her pragmatic, hard-headed style, since her days in the underrated show Fringe. I think she is a great pick to play hardened characters.

A great start. There is quite a bit of breadth and depth to the games, so they have a lot to work with - looking forward to see how the content is interpreted, managed, and portrayed throughout this series.

As most gamer's will have some rough idea where it's all heading, I almost wish I was in the seat of someone going in totally blind but how it is executed will hopefully be a totally new and, oxymoronically, nostalgic experience.

A week is a long time to wait, hahaha. Excited to be here."

See it now right away. Skip work call in sick just watch it.

Pedro Pascal does a awesome job and delivers a fantastic performance. The chemistry between Pedro and Nico Parker was fantastic.

HBO has done it's research and stays close the the sourcematerial.

This was like watching 24 days later for the first time again and if you are a fan of that movie you will most likely love Last Of Us.

The special effects was right up there with trippel A production movies.

I just sat there and hoped that it would never end and i really hope that the rest of the season will be as good as EP1."

Like I said, not one to keep me up all night watching one episode after another sadly, (if it had been possible to do so), might be one for the few who like this stuff, but It did not work with this episode for me, I never watched the series of a similar type, that was not for me either. So it will be on to the next epidode to see if things improve, the hype on this series is way way too high to me. Sorry but my opinion."

Brilliant start to the episode but disappointingly became rather formulaic towards the end .

I'll definitely watch episode 2 but am a tad concerned I may lose interest rather quickly .

The start of the episode rivalled Dawn Of The Dead for foreboding menace but unfortunately it degenerated into another run of the mill Walking Dead type post apocalyptic thriller. I'm pretty sure I'll be able to guess what happens for the rest of the season .

Good enough but certainly not deserving of anything higher than a 7 in my opinion."

Looking forward to more!!! I think the actors gave justice the to roles they're playing! The scene where joel lost her daughter is still heartbreaking.

Truly, HBO does produces quality movies and tv series!

I just can't wait for more! I do hope they make a sequel after season 1. That'll be a blast seeing ellie all grown up and how the audience will take joel's death in the live series as compared to the video game that gave mixed emotions to most players."

Permalink";"The Last of Us is post-apocalyptic TV series. The first part of the pilot is a well-crafted and intense show that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The characters still lack a very well defined developed, due to the initial time jumps, and feels a bit difficult to feel invested this early on. However, there is potential for character building, but the impact of their early stories (pre-apocalyptic) remains to be seen. The pacing of the pilot is overall good but for a 1h15min episode could have explored a bit more of character development and relationships to make us feel more invested. Overall, it's a solid 7 out of 10 pilot. The TV series has potential to either become a hit or a generic zombie post-apocalyptic show, only time will tell.

After the second episode the show is now at most 6/10. The episode pacing is quite bad and bland. The characters do not have believable motivations. The episode wastes 50 minutes where nothing relevant happens to go with the same old formula of something needs to happen in the last 2 minutes. The characters do not have any development, it is unbelievable that the little kid now has such a strong bond that she doesn't want to leave at the end of the episode; when she has spent like a day or two with these people and nothing relevant happens. The characters feel also dumber and dumber everytime, a experienced couple 20 years after the apocalypse still goes with huge and loud rifles into the middle of the city and poorly equiped otherwise. Overall the second episode feels like you are watching a time lapse waiting for the last 5 minutes for something to happen to keep you engaged. However what also happens is quite poor and recycled formula of many other last zombie shows.

The third episode makes the series completly average. An episode that is disconnected from the pace of the series. It just offers an filler to meet episode guidelines from the producer or something because otherwise it does not make any sense. Yes, it is a good love story, like many others, but completly misses the point of sending any message relevant to the characters progression. This story should have been fitted in all three episodes so far, and have it interact with the main characters to feel somewhat relevant. In this way it was just a nice story completly out of nowhere, for no purpose. This downgrades this series to a best 6/10 so far."

Everyone should watch this series and go on a journey of self discovery, emotional attachments and relationships.

Outstanding. 10 years since its game release, it is still one of the best-looking games ever, and one of the most intriguing stories ever told.

The story is great, the characters are compelling, from the mains like Ellie & Joel to the side characters like Tess, Bill, Marlene, David, and others. They're memorable as hell, and each leaves an impression on the viewers with their emotional impact and plot significance, with Joel and Ellie being at the forefront of this. The story centers around the two of them, their interactions, and the presentation of the hardships that they've gone through together throughout the series. Their relationship developed and grew into familial love, more specifically a Father-Daughter connection."

Permalink";"When the first trailer initially released, I didn't have high expectations for this show. I was sure it was just going to be another dumb-but-fun unnecessary film/series adaptation of an amazing video game, like Resident Evil or Uncharted. Still interested though, when the first episode for the series premiered last night, I was keen to see the outcome. Despite my mixed expectations, I was pleasantly surprised. The tension building, the writing, the camerawork, the score. It's all so beautiful. It managed to faithfully capture the game's essence and story - but wasn't an exact photocopy (unlike 2016's Ratchet and Clank, which literally used cutscenes from one of the games in the series, which had come out only a couple weeks before). While I'd already played through most of the game before watching the series, the first 40 minutes had me at the edge of my seat. Dozens of emotions were floating across my mind as tears trickled down my face. My doubts about Pedro Pascal playing Joel were completely washed away as the actor proved all throughout the pilot that he literally can't miss. I sympathized with him and a lot of the other characters much more than I had expected, which was a nice surprise because the casting had given me some doubts before going into it. The one character I couldn't stand was Ellie, played by Bella Ramsey. Her expressions were entirely lifeless, and all of her acting fell incredibly flat. The funny, crude one-liners the writers gave the character were completely ruined by the horrible delivery. Maybe it'll grow on me, though, so I'll give it some time. I have yet to see what the rest of the show brings to the table, but so far, I am very happy with the results. It's obviously not for everyone, but if you like the games and have an open enough mind to ignore the slightly different appearances of some of the characters, I'd definitely recommend to check it out."

Pedro is phenomenal as JOEL and so is Gabiel luna as Tommy. The 1 hr 20 min long episode went by in like a few minutes.. HBO has done a great job bringing in the same music composer who composed for the game and the same theme song as the game.. That was a massive W. The characters, the lore, the action scenes were very well adapted. And Bella is so good as Ellie, I knew she was perfect within seconds. Great casting there HBO. Bravo!! This series is for us fans.

The story, directing, the acting are all excellent. I am already hooked and looking forward for more episodes. Pedro Pascal is excellent as Joel Miller. I love this casting. He captured Joel Miller very well. The first episode with Sarah and Tommy which is the first 15 minutes of the game is brilliant.

This show will be one or probably the best zombie / post apocalypse tv show. Tess played by Anna Torv is excellent as well. Bella Ramsay as Ellie is great too. The 3 main actors bring natural acting to the show. Nico Parker in episode 1 as Sarah Miller is magnificent. Great job HBO!"

As a general audience, I love it when a show stays faithful to the source material while adding some twists to surprise old-timers.

As a former avid gamer who finished the original game 3 times, I'm so glad they add new things to give the character and story more depth while keeping the detail that made the game so good in the first place.

Although I know the story from start to finish , I find everything in this show entertaining as if I experience the story for the time.

HBO really kicked off a new year with a bang!

Superb production, top-notch acting, and compelling storytelling!"

I think the cast on a whole have done a fantastic job of giving us something we wanted to see presented in the TV series but no matter how hard I try I cannot see Bella Ramsey as Ellie, she just is not a good fit, I ddon't understand how they made the choice when there were so many other options but now we are stuck with a lack lustre lead and it hurts because the story will pay for it.

I hope she starts to improve in the role after the first episode but I cannot see it."

Permalink";"For years i've been pretty vocal about my distaste for TLoU video game series. While I don't think the games are bad, they just were never really for me, so hearing HBO has a new series based on the game coming out I assumed it was a recipe for disaster.

The first episode did its best to prove me wrong.

While I found the first act to be pretty standard, things quickly begin to pickup and I found the well acted characters and great set design to encapsulate the feeling of the games perfectly. The story being gripping should be nothing new to fans of the games but some of the scenes were reenacted flawlessly with even a bit of subversion for the keen-eyed. It got to the point where every scene had me worried that I was that much closer to the end of what I expected to be a long 1:24.

Things were great all around, editing was good, the effects looked incredible, and the writing even lifting lines word for word from the source material, which was fun for me to remember as someone who wasn't even a fan. I can only hope my familiarity with the games isn't causing bias for me and that general audiences enjoy it as much as I.

If the series continues the way the first episode did, I am quite excited to see what HBO is gonna give us with TLoU. HBO having a hit series is nothing new, I'm just hoping if this pops off we may get more video game adaptations with a bit more competence behind them."

I was worried because I have yet to see a truly faithful and well done video game adaptation besides maybe Sonic but I certainly would not put that in the same category. That said, I was happy with the casting and the trailer was promising. The show has far exceeded expectations so far. The casting has been as good as I could imagine so far, the set pieces give me deja Vu from the game, and the writing is incredible. I was geeking out every time the show pulled exact scenes and dialogue from the game. Yes there are some changes but they all make sense for turning it into a show, none of them were disappointing and it preserves the most important scenes. This is sometimes even down to the exact camera angle or ""shot"" from the game. I could get nitpicky but truly it's so far an exceptional adaptation that again, far exceeded my expectations."

I feel like no one is saying this and I'm just gonna say it: the stupid tendrils coming from the mouths are heartbreakingly stupid. A freshly infected old woman is just going to have those things poke out her mouth within hours of infection? They're trying too hard to differentiate from other zombie shows and I think the tendrils are a mistake. There was plenty of room for growths later in the show and there was no need to spend CGI budget on something so absurd when they could of sold it as a 28 days later style zombie thriller and reveal the visual fungal parts later on in the series.

Other than that, I guess it was an okay pilot episode. I wish I could watch the whole season already like the press was able to last week. But those tendrils are killing me."

That is all that was ever needed, you respect the fans, pay attention to the details and do not change characters or storylines to meet your agenda.

At a technical level, cinematography and sound design is excellent. Nothing ground breaking, but good enough to do justice to the situation and tell the story. The performances so far has also been solid and gives me a lot of hope for more intense moments that are lined up in the future.

A must watch for Video Game fans and anyone who likes their zombies!! It's not a generic zombie show either, it discovers the politics and economic state of the colony the survivors form, for example the main character Joel resorts to selling drugs for a form of payment known as Tags which replaces the traditional US dollar.

The series is gritty and emotional, and perfectly portrays the atmosphere and story of the video games.

It's definitely one of the best streaming exclusive tv series that has come out so far! Pedro Pascals performance is amazing and you can feel everything he feels, the cinematography and sound design really cements you into the world of the last of us!

TL;DR a must watch for all post-apocalypse fans, even if you haven't played the game.

I really dislike shows and movies where the setting is a horror one yet the emphasis is on bonding and characters growing to depend on each other. Seems like the horror elements are there just to put the main characters in jeopardy so they can bond some more.

A show that focus on a adult with a young girl gets boring really, really quick. Look at all the characters in Lost, they never got boring because they were interesting characters with some haunting back stories. And each week brought a new mystery. Lost did it right. The Last of Us looks like it will become like so many of these kind of shows; the women will go ""Owww"" and the guys will be saying ""Going to the pub"".

Was looking forward to this but only gamers will probably stick with it."

NO I HAVE NEVER PLAYED THE VIDEO GAME, (I think this is an interesting comment for my review.) To make it very simple, this series looks like a very high budget quality movie, divided in several episodes and seasons.

I was skeptical to watch a series in a post-apocalyptic atmosphere with what could be stupidly called ""zombies"", because I never really liked this kind of universe, but this series is different.

Permalink";"As a huge fan of The Last of Us games, I know these games through and through. I know the storyline and have immersed myself into the games. I know it all too well. So, when I heard The Last of Us series was in the works at HBO from Chernobyl creator Craig Mazin and The Last of Us creative director Neil Druckmann in 2020, I was so excited. They worked together to write and produce this project. I was nervous because I hope they would not to fail as in another video games like Resident Evil, Tomb Raider, Mortal Kombat, Doom, and more. Many video games always fail when adapted to television or movies because they don't respect the source material, and they just want to do their own thing. They just with the name for branding. That's why. But in, ""The Last of Us"", HBO did follow the source material well. I'm relieved! I watched the first episode of The Last of Us last night. It was the best video game adaptation I've ever seen! It was historic! It was the perfect episode! As I watched the series, I felt like I was back playing the game. The series was a wonderful balance of adding a more detailed backstory while maintaining the heart of the source material. I was impressed! Minor deviations are done very nicely. The cast is awesome and played their roles as they were in the game. To all the losers that who complained about how terrible Bella Ramsey is in the character portrayed as Ellie in the Last of Us; you are ignorant. Don't watch the series then, just go play the game and stay in the game and enjoy the character in the game all you want. It's so ridiculous! Open your mind! It's an adaptation! Bella did awesome in first episode. I can't wait to see how she does in the further episodes. Now I see All the Bella haters are very quiet today! Of course, incredible cinematography and awesome shots in the car and plane crash scenes. In my opinion those were the best scenes of the year! Lastly, it was everything I had hoped for as a The Last of Us fan. It was perfect, I am confident that this season is an already a masterpiece, I know this season isn't complete but I can tell it is an already masterpiece."

Permalink";"Disclaimer: This review is from the perspective of a fan of the first game. I find the show lacks much of what was so entertaining in the game. The suspense and pacing are off. Much like the so-so Uncharted film, this show feels like a hollow experience. The characters are miscast, character traits are altered for some unknown purpose, plot points and world ideas are changed for what seems like no other reason except to be different from the source material, etc. This seems to be another disappointing project much in the way ""The Walking Dead"" from AMC turned out to be. Rather then wanting to see what happens next, I found myself reaching for the remote to skip ahead much like ""Rings of Power"". For those that haven't played the games, they may find something to enjoy but I think the overall boring presentation and poor pacing may turn them off. For those that have played the first game, it's going to either be a lacking / disappointing parody of the source material or a potentially interesting altered take on the world. For me, my journey ends with episode one. Such a shame."

So I missed the backstory behind Joel and Ellie. But I can say I agree with how the first hour played out in regards to a real world outbreak. The first scene with the runners looked good. The way they run and act along with them being clumsy etc... is true to the game. Haven't seen them yet but the previews showing the clickers looked good too. We shall see. I'm wondering if they are gonna have the other ones from the game this season. I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't. Save it for the next one. I think if they keep wokeism away from the show it will be good. So far a 9 I'd say."

Changes were made. It's not a completely faithful adaptation. We get different faces for the original characters and slight changes in the plot but the fundamentals of the story and the overall tone are the same. Moreover, as TV is the more passive form of entertainment compared to a game, the authors can use a slightly slower pace and add more depth to the narrative. This is smart story-telling as the writers realize the different strengths of different types of media.

The set design leaves little to be desired. The cinematography is great. They even kept the more 'zoomed-in' quality of the gaming experience during the early action sequences. The acting is good. The directing is competent.

No matter if you know the game or don't: This is good entertainment and the first episode will leave you wanting more."

There were some variations to the story and as promised by the creators, many big variations are coming in the future episodes (Especially Episode 3 which some critics are saying is one of the greatest episodes of television history). I had mid expectations but episode 1 blew my mind. It is a perfect pilot and I am really excited to see whats coming next. We will see more fleshed out characters particularly stretching out Bill's storyline and a major story change from video games with a few jaw dropping twists. I think this show works because Neil Druckmann is heavily involved in the project and every decision made to the script is closely supervised by him. It shows that this is not another cash grab but they really do care about the original story."

Permalink";"***"" Update after watching the full series ****

Well I think overall Id give this a 7 or 8, the opening episode was definitely a 9 the rest of the show would be getting either 7 or 8s depending on how appealing they were to me.

Everything was well made, well acted, well shot etc. The brutality of it all was maintained throughout. I watched some of the game footage on you tube and there is a lot here that is identical to the game so thats a plus for fans of the game plus it works for a TV show so kudos to the game makers.

The story and overlying themes are very simple and relate to parenting and how we protect our children or the young.

It could have had more Cordyceps and more action in places but this was more of a drama surrounding the struggles of a broken world.

Overall ill give it an 8 out of 10 a very good Tv Show that stays loyal to its source and was very well produced.

**** Update *******

Ill start by saying I've never played the games, I've no idea how true to the source it is.

The first episode was very impressive, they told hold back here and emotionally you are involved quite early on.

The prologue was informative but understated, The opening was brilliant and as good as anything you would see in a movie.

The middle section is good and paced well to provide enough information going forward as to the objective the players and whats happened to the world outside.

The episode ends at the start of an adventure.... I hope this quality remains throughout the show so the adventure is as good as the opening ( a hard act to follow ).

Ive enjoyed the characters so far, not all likeable but our lead Pedro Pascal is familiar and trustworthy and does a good job. Bella Ramsey of Game of Thrones fame plays the female lead, I really hated her in Game of Thrones, her acting is a bit less wooden here so I hope I don't end up hating her in this. So far she has been fine.

Its only 1 episode but its probably a 9 out of 10. I would be shocked if they can keep up this sort of standard and narrative throughout the series. Having said that there is plenty of scope for some interesting scenes. Im not a big fan of Zombie films or shows but can find them entertaining. ( I found Black Summer S2 brilliant )

I hope this doesn't turn out to be just another zombie show.

9/10 ( Ep1)"

There is really too much ""filler"" for this episode with over 80% of Episode 1 being filler, there is literally a 15 minute episode here so far. Now, I don't know if this was because of poor casting choices or bad directing, but all of the acting performances for the main characters have been bland, boring and at times very crappy. I typically wouldn't care about the casting choices being different to the source material, which in this case would be the video game, if the performance is good. After all, to this day I still prefer and enjoy Brandy's performance as Cinderella (1997) to any other version cause that one is so well-written and acted that I didn't care about the casting choice being different or diverse. Story is not accurate to the source material and again if better, wouldn't care about minor story changes. Other than that, the photography is great and since I haven't yet seen the special effects on the Clickers to give a proper opinion, I will update with that later."

The direction is absolutely on point and everything from the scenery, the lighting and the music is spot on too. They have really done their homework on this and I already know it will triumph where other video game adaptations have failed in the last.

The pacing is just about right, and the well written characters are beautifully brought to live by the actors.

Will the success of this show finally convince the idiots with the money that maybe, just maybe they can actually make more money and generate more acclaim by having the actual games creator write the adaptation? Without that awful age old excuse that a game writer couldn't possibly handle the job of writing a tv show/movie...

Just imagine a Resident Evil show that was actually faithful, imagine God of War with this level of competence. Imagine Hollywood keeping the creators of these successful IP's in charge, and you'll imagine a better more entertaining world.

So will Hollywood learn their lesson? Don't hold your breath but let's hope so."

I had my doubts about Pedro Pascal as Joel, but boy was I proven wrong! Kind of like Robert Pattinson's as Batman. The series is slow paced enough for anyone to Enjoy but the Eerie atmosphere quickly pulls you into the story. I think Gamers can appreciate the accuracy with which the first episode was created. The special effects will put many Hollywood blockbusters to shame and the Atmos soundtrack is among the best out there. I won't be spoiling anything, but I can hardly remember a show having me on the edge of my seat like this one, especially due to the Atmos soundtrack, the excellent special effects And just the dark side of humanity when the proverbial sh*t hits the fan.

I already hope that there will be a second season. In case you get lost in the darkness of these time, this series can bring you some light and hope. Mando can leave his helmet on so Joel can fix his watch. A win/win situation if you ask me. Can' t wait for episode 2. Enjoy the ride!"

Star Wars did this very well with a saga and mystique and humor, The Walking Dead with the people cemestry but so far this shows' (only seen one episode yet) dialogue and setting has been ... expected and without any real tension building (Eg the scene where the team forms is just boilerplate writing).

So I was following the tv show from scene to scenes to compare with the videogame, although there were a couple of scenes that they did differently, but overall it was pretty damn gooood! Even though I knew exactly what was going to happen, I was still pretty excited and intense. Well done HBO, this was amazing I just hope it continues to impress the audience like this, as long as the story is the same, I'm sure the tv show can be as good as the videogame."

But episode one delivered and beyond. It brought me back to the game so many years ago and they nailed it.

I was skeptical for the role of Joel and Ellie, but both of them are doing an excellent job so far. Joel has an intensity that I wasn't sure this actor could deliver and that is crucial for making the story work. Alright, Ellie, we all lived so many hours with this character that you have a certain image in your head about who to play the role. And I don't know who else could do it. We have to see how she holds up through the story but high hopes none the less.

If the serie can hold this level of accuracy then damn, we are in for a treat!

For anyone that has played the game, the intro will be a very welcome trip down memory lane. And from there, you'll recognize so much from the game. And that's rather unique when it comes to game adaptions.

Usually, whenever adaptions happen, such as Halo or The Witcher, the creators have to put their own twist to the story, which generally ends up ruining it. That doesn't happen in The Last of Us. It's a breath of fresh air, honestly. Who would've thought it's possible to make a game adaption and actually be faithful to the source material for once?

While it's wonderful to watch this tv show after playing the game, it's not a requirement. It's just as enjoyable if not more, because you get to experience the story for the first time. And, based on the pilot, it'll follow the game's story pretty much to the letter, which means you're in for a treat.

If it keeps this up, it'll surely become a 10, but for now, since it's only just the pilot episode, I'll give it a 9."

I was afraid it wouldn't live up to my expectations, but I must say that I loved the first episode.

There were many scenes that looked exactly like the video game. For example, when Joel, Sarah and Tommy are in the car in the beginning, the way we see from Sarah's perspective and how the camera rotates inside the car to film Sarah! I felt like I as playing all over again.

So far, it's fateful to the video game.

I think the cast is well chosen, as I see and hear them I remember them as the video game characters immediately, and got flashbacks from the game.

The story here is a riff on Richard Matheson's ""I Am Legend"", with modern cinematic sensibilities and influences from The Walking Dead and the Fallout games.

So it's not at all an original story. But that doesn't matter, because it's done very well. The cast is wonderful, and the story has a strong emotional core.

I have played both of the last of us games and to my recollection it has pretty much the same beginning. Maybe some different things if I'm not mistaken. It's been a while since i have played the games...

It would be an excellent series for people who haven't played the games anyway. There are also small references to the games in the series. The angle of the scene where Sarah wakes up in bed, the movie Sarah watched with Joel. These are good references. There is more. But personally, I would prefer that they tell another story to expand the universe like they did in the second game. They could tell a different story with troops like fireflies in a different city. It will still be a good series. Even though I already know what will happen in the other episodes, I can't wait."

When someone tells that they adapt a video game to TV series, it is a little thought-provoking. What happens if they fail? But thanks to Neil Druckmann and HBO, i watched something amazing and breathtaking. It was perfect. Scenes from game fits perfectly to camera. While watching, I always thought about the same scene from game and those scenes are so similar. It's so admired thing that they stick by game, original story. Especially, Pedro Pascal's potrayal as Joel was breathtaking. It is exactly the same thing i imagined before. Also Bella Ramsey performs incredible as Ellie. You can see that Ellie vibe. Hope I can feel same things for next episodes. Thanks for making this happen. This is very special and emotional story for us, and it's great to see that this story is telling by great, wonderful actors. Thank you all."

Everything about this show is perfect. The casting and acting is excellent. Pedro Pascal nails his role as Joel. The attention to detail by the creators is astounding, with everything from the clothes, to the lines and cinematography. I'm am so please they chose Gustavo Santaolalla for music as his music was one of the focal points of the game.

As a huge TLOU fan, this show is perfection, but it is also made in a way that hopefully will appeal to the people who haven't played the games.

If you're on the fence, please jump off and watch this show. You will not regret it."

Utterly speechless. I am a HUGE fan of the franchise, and I'm truly gagged. I love how the first episode focuses more on Sarah's perspective on the day of the outbreak, because of how little time we got in the game to get to know her character. Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey are the PERFECT Joel and Ellie. Everything about it is pure perfection. Absolutely my favorite. Bar none."

Words cannot describe how well made this video game adaptation is, very faithful to the games (something you don't usually get) while adding things players have never seen before. If you have played the games before, some may recognise that some scenes are beat for beat, line for line from the game, and executed to perfection. Acting is perfect, a highlight is Pedro Pascal as Joel, a perfect portrayal of a caring father turned hardened survivor. Many were lead to believe the casting for Ellie was a wrong choice, but Bella Ramsay knocks it out of the park and gives a great performance as Ellie. This show is a must watch, for people who have played the game and people who have not."

Almost everything is verbatim to the game in the first episode and Naughty Dog's storytelling shines through.

I wasn't completely sold on Pedro Pascal as Joel, but I am starting to see it, the next episodes will solidify his Joel persona, hopefully!

Ellie is also a surprising good fit for the role and I can't wait to see more of her in the next episodes.

The atmosphere and the post apocalyptic vibe is also spot on, FEDRA and the Fireflies are nicely represented as well.

All in all this has the makings of a great show! Don't mess it up guys!"

It's not the Walking Dead at all and it totally keeps you involved with the story line.

The way they frame things is so accurate, you can tell they did their homework and KNEW us fans would be up their butts about details.

At least there's an attempt at an explanation in this one. However, the variation on the zombie theme is tiresome and burned out because no one has come up with an original idea in so very, very long. In this version, there is some creativity and intelligence. The cast is quite good, the special effects are superior but it's predictable stuff and as far as story it's nothing we haven't seen, heard, or been bored by before. So sad there's nothing but the same old, same old."

Permalink";"As an enthusiast gamer who has played Last of Us 1 and 2 and an avid watcher of TV shows, the show has been as per my expectations so far, however, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau could have been a better option for the portrayal of JOEL's character. Anyhow hoping for a thrilling series ahead... 9/10.

The Last of Us subverts narrative expectations for its specific genre by straying away from focusing on survival. Though the characters clearly want to stay alive, the series does not concern itself with heavily focusing on Joel and Ellie's conflicts with others - they're there, of course, but that's not what this series is about. These episodes are about the relationship that is formed between Joel and Ellie, two people separated by generation and bound by necessity, as they travel across the dangerous landscape that the United States has become. They must not only deal with the Infected, the cannibalistic fungus-covered monsters, but also the deadly people that have been forged by the new world. Everyone Joel and Ellie come into contact with have their own distinct motivations for their actions, leaving the audience to decide their own beliefs on the morality of these decisions. The Last of Us might not be as graphic as the video game it's adapted from, but that makes it no less intense. There are shocking moments of violence that should be expected from a world like this, such as graphic cannibalistic deaths from Infected or more emotional deaths of younger survivors. That isn't to say the series doesn't have its lighter moments, as there are brief moments of levity peppered throughout the season, especially moments involving the relationship between Joel and Ellie and the jokes they share."

The game is incredibly narrative driven with long cutscenes and immersive environments that fully envelop you in the story., hence the game has always felt like living through a movie. Which is why I was so skeptical about them ""going Holluwood"" with such an incredible piece of storytelling. Shot for shot recreations, great casting and the same score composer for the soundtrack as the game. Brilliant. Genuinely excited for this."

Permalink";"As someone who has spent a lot of time with these games over the years (original, remastered & recent remake), I always wondered why they would even bother making this into a TV series. And after watching the first episode, unfortunately it turned out exactly as expected.

The story (so far!) plays out like a Wikipedia synopsis of the first few hours of the game; without the interactivity of the game, it's just a boring, predictable zombie flick. Everything in it is just 'fine'. They've cut out a lot of the original content (which is fair enough, as this would feel like filler once dramatised I think) such as the first couple of missions, but aside from that, scene by scene it mirrors the game. Even the introduction is pretty much EXACTLY the same as the game, minus any of the impact, grit or emotion that anyone who has played the game will have experienced.

Personally I don't really understand the casting; Joel is a pretty generic character anyway (Dylan McDermott would at least have looked like him) but the girl who plays Ellie misses the mark entirely, and the girl that plays Tess is similarly dull and unimaginative.

Overall, the whole thing just seems a bit meh! I was hoping they might have at least expanded on some plot points with all the lore (not to mention the DLC backstory) and appreciate it's only the first episode. But if it carries on just mirroring everything that happens in the game, then the whole thing just seems like a huge waste of money!"

I saw a few Easter eggs that tie in with the game. Pedro and Bella are on fire in the first episode! Bella is amazing as Ellie!!! Nico Parker nailed her role as Sarah ( Nico looks so much like her actress mom)

The effects and how they made the world look post apocalyptic is amazing. There was a few jump scares for me, which I liked cause I wasn't expecting it. There are differences from the game and show but so far it's been a lot more faithful to the game than other video game to show/movies I have seen and it's only the first episode.

If you like walking dead, resident evil, any zombie apocalypse movie/tv show/games this is the show for you. 10/10!"

Great acting from Pedro Pascal, Bella Ramsey, Merle Dandridge, Gabriel Luna, Nico Parker and Anna Torv in the first episode. They know how to bring the characters to life and make the characters their own character.

I cannot wait to see how the rest of the series progress and to see how the actors grow and progress into their roles.

I know this has been long time in the making. And now is finally on the screen after a ten year wait."

For me, it is not a fiction its very reasonable line of event which might possibly occur in the same way as the author portrays.

Pedro Pascal is a great choice for mixed characters and he is natural with very honest facial impressions.

Bella Ramsey at first sight depicts a wicked and crafty girl, just the necessary face and the game is truly stunning.

What I liked about the series also, the fact that they don't linger too much around horrible monsters, yet they detail what horrors might human kind do to survive.

In my opinion, the human race is very dangerous compared to other species should we be cornered, it would be very unpredictable how we would react."

Saying that I absolutely loved the film version of uncharted unlike many. I need not have worried! This show knocked it totally out of the park.

It is a huge reminder of just how good tv should be.

Even none gamers will love this show; scary, emotional and amazing SFX, acting & writing make this the best thing I have seen either in the cinema or tv in very many years.

The production values are outstanding, an 80 minute first episode that I will watch again. I do feel that a 9.6 is a bit high with some questionable moments including a grown man carrying a child being able to outrun (due to a few obstacles) an infected person. Not every TV show can be made this way, studios will go bust. But if 2023 starts with this and ends up season 2 of Severance, 2023 will be a great year for quality content."

So I might've been skeptical when I heard this series be announced however still had my hopes up high since I had a passionate towards the original game. I might just say that this is one of the best to ever be released not only for the way naughty dog and Neil Druckmann decide to stick it close to the same powerful story, but also with visually remarkable direction and strong performances from every actor thus far.

Pedro Pascal as Joel is perfect for the role as he channels the deep trauma and emotion that voice actor Troy Baker was once able to do for the character. Bella Ramsey is also great as Ellie and will be definitely exciting to see more of her later in the series. Also these episodes are longer than an hour and the first episode literally felt like a movie that feels like the fastest hour and twenty ever. It nicely paced. And finally all of the callbacks to the originals makes this show feel like a love letter to the fans as well as something new for people who haven't played the original game."

The serie is absolutely, without a doubt, one of the greatest tv shows ever created...it's damn near perfect!

All you have to do is go google ""greatest tv shows of all-time"" and I guarantee you that it's at or near the top of every list you'll find and there's a reason for that...because it is!

Any concerns I had about Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey as Joel and Ellie, vanished within the first 30mins.

There are so many recognisable scenes recreated from the game that it felt familiar, yet had enough changes and ""tweaks"" to make it feel new too.

Certain things that happen in the game are reimagined but still occur and progress the story effectively.

There was no way that Neil Druckman was going to let his ""baby"" get ruined! I have seen a documentary about the making of the game back in 2013, and he directed the motion capture scenes himself. It was evident from that how much passion he had for the project back then, and that passion has not waned AT ALL!!

If you haven't played the game - watch this! Or play the game first then watch this!

If you have played the game - STILL watch this!! In any way shape or form, watch this if you like genuine, gritty and emotionally driven horror drama shows.

What has been regarded as the ""Best story ever told in a videogame"" (it won well over 200 awards...) has come to the medium of TV and by the looks of things, has lost nothing of it's impact!

Oh, and remember ""Chernobyl"" also created by Craig Mazin, was the highest rated show on IMDB for months... he knows what he's doing!"

The show isn't an exact copy of the game but how could it be? It wouldn't be exciting if we saw Ellie and Joel finding ladders like in the game would it. It has to be a continuous story. Regardless, I'm blown away and can't wait to see more. I am especially loving the use of light in the scenes of the first episode, it perfectly manifests that dusty run down city and sets the atmosphere very well.

But... to my delight - this is good. Very good. The world building, cinematography, story, directing, and the acting are all top notch. If they keep this up this will be a huge hit for hbo, and for the franchise.

Seeing Joel and Ellie in this format was a joy. I must say I was more than a little critical of the choice of Bella Ramsey as Ellie. But, it seems to work very well, and I really liked her interpretation of Ellie.

I really hope this continue to be as good as the first episode. There's only one really big problem with this series and that is - the weekly format! I hate that and thought we left that behind forever. And not it's back, and you have to wait a week between episodes. That's bad. Really bad."

Permalink";"As a constant fan of immersive apocalyptic and science fiction stories, I have always been left disappointed with movie adaptations - I know certain changes need to be done eventually to make the adaptation, but other producers and writers seem to forget entirely that as long as you maintain the vibe of what you are adapting and not changing tons of unnecessary stuff, you are good.

You can feel the passion put into this production from start to end. I heard the director saying he was a fan in 2013 at the launch of the game bawling at Sarah's scene - should I say he nailed it 10 years later!

Even though things are changed, I can logically see how they help the tv series flow more seamlessly and they don't impact the larger thread of events or the vibe of it. We also get some extra scenes so we can better understand what happened the day of the outbreak, as well as what it's like for Joel and Tess to work a mundane job in the post apocalyptic world. FEDRA's cruelty is also displayed more evidently and we get to understand why the Fireflies are such an important and growing organisation in their world. I love it!

Hope we get to see even more backstories on Joel, Tommy and Tess, and why not Marlene and how the organisations were formed... but for now, a 10/10

P. S. As a Depeche Mode fan, I leaped at the end of the first episode with happiness. Great choice of music overall!"

Pedro Pascal plays Joel, and has given tremendous strength to the show by being a caring father and a care taker. You need such men in Post-Apocalyptic world. The sets are brilliant as well. I would say the class of Chernobyl is pretty evident in this show. The story is building up and the first episode has just set the tone right. Bella who plays Ellie has come strong after her performance in Game of Thrones. I think this is the next big thing on HBO. The story line is nothing new but the way its being presented is brilliant. The first episode has set high standards! Lets see how the rest goes!!"

The man just knows how to create tension and intensity on the screen you just can't keep your eyes off it!

The undisputed greatest live-action adaptation of a video game bar none!

The whole atom bomb!!!! It would be wrong to say great. The hallmark of a good TV series is that a tension will work from the very first episode. From this point of view it is 100% successful.

Also fond of other post-apocalypse movies and series, and this is so far the best. In my opinion, this is TWD+ZNATION+ANNIIHLATION, with a better storytelling and character building. And outstanding performances (so far ALL of them with S1E1).

Will not go into details about how the story goes. But the best part of this series (so far) is the gradual, but not prolonged, development of how it happened. The beginning TV interviews simply laid out a quite intimidating though *unlikely* scenario for all. And the father daughter relationship is just pure and precise. It is absolutely necessary for any further development of the duo, and explains the reason why Joel would go ""all-in"" helping Ellie get through the journey. Bella Ramsey is awesome. Pedro Pascal is awesome. You know they are acting, but you can't tell if they are acting or if they are expressing their true emotions. And Anna Torv is just the most reasonably baddest badass lady from all these kind of end-of-world TV series. Can't wait to see what else the show brings to us."

Permalink";"I was skeptical about watching this show as video game adaptations have high record rates of failure. However after watching the first episode premiere, I must say it's actually really good. It has a slow exposition since it follows the game's exposition but it's definitely still entertaining & well directed. The casting with the exception of Sarah (she looks way different) is on point so if you're a fan of the game, you won't be disappointed. Ellie could've been casted better for her looks but she definitely acts like Ellie with her mannerisms so I can forgive them for that. It's not bad enough to lose interest in this show, trust me. Scenes also tie into the game really well with minor differences that won't spoil the show so if you're worried, don't be. Overall, I think this show is a must watch & has the potential to be TV show of the year if done correctly. (Very least nominated) They proved they can make a good video game adaptation so far so let's hope this continues to be a positive experience. 8/10 stars so far but I will change it if it gets better or worse. Would I recommend this show? Yes!"

Acting is on point, tempo is fantastic... I didnt play video game(shame on me,yeah?) but I ll definitely watch this HBO gem. Of course, Pedro Pasqual is at his best and The Last of Us will, probably, be another success after Mandalorian. Honestly, I expected less from the first episode but it took me in with a few starting minutes and held me until the end. Colors are decent, casting is good enough but I 'm glad that it's just one episode weekly cause of everything that happened in the last two-three years with pandemic and all around. However, all recomendations for this one."

As far as I'm concerned, it was perfect. The ""prologue"" portion set the stage beautifully for what was to come later in the episode, which captured the trudging hopelessness so incredibly well portrayed in the games.

It's clear that the showrunners understood the appeal of the original source material and that they wanted to stay true to that (bringing on Last of Us game writer/director Neil Druckmann was proof enough) and they nailed it. Many sequences are even shot-for-shot the way they were in the video game cutscenes.

Writing, direction, setting were superb, add in some spot-on casting (especially Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey), combine that with the heavy, oppressive atmosphere the games are so well known for, and you have the makings of the greatest video game adaptation ever made.

If this first episode is an indication of things to come, that's exactly what HBO has done."

The show is written by Niel Druckman himself and as such stays true to the character arcs. The actors have been casted brilliantly and it really feels like watching the live action version of the game itself.

There is hardly any words that can properly display the amount of emotions the first episode puts you through, and is an amazing pilot episode.

Whether you've played the game or not, this show delivers changes whilst keeping the overall story similar.

The actors are otherworldly, Pedro Pascal as Joel is an amazing casting choice and he performs horrifyingly well.

Bella Ramsey, despite negative feedback on her visual comparison to Ellie in the games, delivers a true-to-life performance and captures the spirit of a teenager who hasn't truly been subjected to the horrors of the real world yet. It creates this gut-wrenching feeling that makes you- along with Joel- want to protect Ellie from the horrors of the Cordyceps virus."

First of all the production design is phenomenal. Perhaps you expect nothing less of a high-budget show in 2023, but it's still breathtaking to look at. Everything looks realistic and lived in which adds tension and a sense of realness that makes the show even more stressful to watch.

All you need for a successful tv-show is Pedro Pascal. He is one of the greatest actors in the history of television and he delivers a superb performance in ""The Last of Us""."

I've played the game a few times all the way through already, so i can recall what events lined up with what the show is based off and thats the game. Right off the back the start is way different, they have a flash back of men talking about the virus back in 1968. They flash forward to modern day to give it a little bit more back story and then boom it goes to zombies just like the game so A+ there. I dont have any complaints, my only thing is if you're trying to make a show or movie based on a game, get people who look like the characters. Other then these few things the show is so far very similar to the game and they've done a great job. I think you should watch it if you haven't played the game and don't want to."

Permalink";"So this show was created based on a very popular video game. Going in there knowing that made absolutely no difference because it was all around just amazing. The actors were top notch, you can really feel the dystopian setting grip you as everything goes from a normal world to a complete nightmare. The explanation as to how this could come about in the intro was genius, they wasted no time moving on to the actual world and what happened to it.

Joel is in a place where he's just trying to get what's left of his family back together, and fighting as hard as he can with every ounce of energy he has left to do it. He has an ally and now he has cargo to take with him. They happen upon Ellie through sheer bad luck(or so it seems) and the story just keeps getting more and more interesting from there.

The way this is designed you won't see things coming, you'll know something's going to happen but you're not quite sure how, and the show is too dynamic for you to have an episode to think about it. There are too many things happening too quickly, so enjoy the ride. 10/10 so far I'm loving this."

It helps the the source material is incredibly detailed, nuanced and immersive - playing the game is in fact like playing a movie - but even if viewers haven't played the game, it's an absolute win.

The show is beautifully shot and directed, superbly acted and while faithful to the game, introduces believable and credible new characters to the narrative that make sense. Having Neil Druckman on board was a master stroke, without his influence this could have been any other generic post-apocalyptic tick-the-box exercise.

They struck just the right balance between staying true to the source, to the smallest details, and making it fresh for existing audiences as well as new ones. Really taking whats already there in the game and expanding on it for the TV Show, greatly enhancing the story in a different way.

Acting is great across the board and I was really pleasantly surprised with casting choices that left me cautious at first. Action feels snappy but is used very sparingly which has a result that makes the violence feel like it should, harrowing and dangerous."

Sirens blaring, emergency vehicles passing by more and more, odd stories on a radio and a old wheelchair bound woman convulsing in the background. Tension mounts until hearts are broken due to excellent performances. As a fan of the games none of what is presented in the opening comes as a surprise, yet it is so expertly crafted that I still managed to cry knowing exactly what was going to happen.

Years go by and the story barely slows down as the world building keeps me glued to the screen. The budget is really on display in the Last of Us with handcrafted sets that ooze authenticity. Without dragging this review out much longer. I think fans of the video game or people who have never played TLOU will enjoy the pilot. HBO has delivered a great first impression handling one of my favorite video game properties."

The very first episode is an indication that this is probably going to be one of the greatest TV adaptation of all times! They changed a few elements without losing the essence of the original storyline.

The dialogue in the video game series is so great that they were able to us most of it in the show, which you rarely (if ever) see in tv adaptations.

If you have never played the game, you probably don't feel the same way that thousands of others, including myself, felt while watching the first episode. I urge you to use this next week to buy and play the video game before watching the next episode.

And if I am feeling this way, I can't imagine how amazing this must be for newcomers. If the show can keep doing (or even improve on) what they have displayed so far, then not only will they have really delivered on this adaptation, but maybe even created a truly amazing TV experience for viewers both old and new.

Also, so far, I am loving the risks they have taken to add more details and depth to the story; filling out those gaps that may have existed in how the story was presented in the game. This is also a great thing for me since it's new content that I was not expecting.

I only gave it an 8 as we are still getting started. And I felt that somehow certain events of the pilot were a little more emotional and/or had a better delivery when I played through it in the game. But that's just how I feel personally."

I think this adaptation will be incredible and truly will break the video game adaptation curse. I cant wait to see what they change, add in and keep loyal to the game. Absolutely incredible. I love you tlou <3."

I wasn't expecting much, normally adaptations tend to disappoint me. But this time HBO surprised. This is indeed an adaptation.

Who was worried about the actors not being completely similar to the game, can watch carefree, although some physical characteristics are different, you will feel inside the game. Pedro Pascal will likely win an Emmy.

There's not much to talk about. The first episode was just perfect, that's the only possible word to describe it.

If Next episodes keep up at this level, it has everything to be one of the best series of all time (if not the best).

The car scene, when the plane crashes, is so perfect that I felt inside the game."

The atmosphere, the characters and the story, everything perfectly aligned to the game. The first episode does a great job of setting the scene for the rest of the show and settings Joel up as the badass he is. Ellie's back too, and this time with more of an attitude than ever. I gotta say while I originally didn't think the casting of Bella Ramsay was good, her acting skills really do speak for themself. I'm gonna keep this review short but I just gotta say, if you're on the edge about watching this. Please do, it's fantastic!"

Only one episode in and i am incredibly impressed! I knew what was going to happen yet the emotions and dark connotations bled through the screen with sheer perfection.

Each actor is perfectly cast so far, even Ellie who i was a tad apprehensive about. Pedro Pascal goes from strength to strength in his career, he is Joel in every way.

As i said, only one episode down but this so far is perfection. I hope the show carries on like it has done so far, this could and most probably will be the next gem HBO uncovers!"

The production of the show seems really good, maybe that's what is expected of any HBO show but considering some of their recent projects this is definitely a positive point of the show Wirth mentioning. The acting is indeed solid regardless of what people would say about casting before the show was released. The story is well-polished and captivating and is perfectly fit to one episode. I do hope that the rest of the show is as great as the first episode."

Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey are amazing, and the next episodes are gonna prove to us that Pedro is a first class actor. Nico Parker was amazing too.

The cinematography, music, VFX and the whole set and design were amazing. Thanks HBO.

I do hope this show turns out to be even better than the game as this genre or this idea of games becoming tv shows/movies proved itself to be bad and the stereotype that follows is not that good. But it seems that everything so far going well and we're probably gonna see the history be wrote in front of us!"

Permalink";"When The Last of Us series on HBO was announced, we all had our prejudgments caused by the horrifically executed game adaptations of the past. Such announcement raised rightful concerns as The Last of Us fan base is already full of controversy and a possibly unfaithful and lamely constructed show could have been another disastrous blow to the videogaming world as of presence in live action media. From the get-go I tried to keep a hopeful attitude towards the upcoming show. One of my major reasons to my positive mindset was that The Last of Us was a game that had an extraordinary story, vibe, style, pacing and presence, such that is convenient for a live action adaptation. If you asked me The Last of Us is the definitive game that is suited for a show. It is a blessing to get this compelling story woven in a remarkable video game in this format, making it more accessible and appealing to a broader set of audience.

With the task of fixing the dreadful reputation of videogame adaptations, does The Last of Us show on HBO deliver? Judging exclusively and strictly over the first episode, as it is the only episode released as of today, it does. Despite the burden of expectations, the first episode delivers them all in an acceptably faithful and loyal style, with minor additions, inevitable in an adaptation, that expand and improve upon the early stages of the game. The prelude to the story is as heart pumping, tension packed and heartbreaking as it was in the game with dramatic acting that would leave an impactful effect on those who haven't played the game and going for a spoiler free adventure. If you are someone who played the game, you may not feel as fascinated as you were playing the game's opening hours. I think it is only natural considering it is your second time experiencing the portion of the story. The episode ends on a nice note with the addition and introduction of a new and exciting aspect of the show that wasn't as apparent as it was in the game. It can be considered a method of storytelling, so it doesn't influence the story much but rather the emotions you feel during your experience. I strongly believe that this element, if used more, will make the story a lot more intensely and visibly impactful.

Another component of this show that was discussed a lot prior to the release of the pilot episode was the casting. It may be one of the most important aspects of any adaptation as people are very sensitive over the characters involved. Pedro Pascal is exceptional in the role of Joel. I have been grateful over the casting of Pedro from the start. As there couldn't be a better actor for Joel in my opinion. Pedro Pascal is very experienced specifically for the role of Joel's character as Joel shows deep similarities with the character of the Mandalorian from the Star Wars show he stars in called The Mandalorian. I don't see this brought up a lot, but I strongly believe that this is a significant part of his casting. In The Mandalorian, Pedro Pascal is a grumpy, broken man who is taking on missions to earn money, he gets tasked with the assignment of delivering a high value cargo to somewhere, the cargo being an important and gifted child which he considers as a cargo but later, forms a mighty bond with it. As you can see it is almost the exact story of Joel in The Last of Us which allows me to confidently say that Pedro is the perfect casting and will keep on impressing us in the role of Joel. Pedro Pascal also has the presence of Joel which I value more over the looks, yet he looks sufficiently similar to Joel from the game. Let's talk about Bella Ramsey who probably has been one of the most criticized members of the cast. Yes, she doesn't quite resemble Ellie in the looks but she, just like Pedro Pascal, has the presence and vibe of Ellie. Also Bella Ramsey is a very successful actress, she is very good in the first episode as Ellie. I was very happy with her performance. I believe that more and more people will realize how good of a choice she was.

To end this review, I can gladly say that I was satisfied with the first episode of the show. The game of The Last of Us posses the potential to produce an excellent show. I believe that it won't only end up as a delight for the fans of the games, but rather a major hit for the general audience. A major portion of people that don't play videogames will now get to experience this story. I can proudly say that I am currently satisfied with the first and excited to see the rest of the episodes. If done correctly, the rest of the show and its presentation may change the narrative and future of game adaptations."

So I was really excited for this show while also trying not to be too hopeful because video game adaptations don't usually go well. But I'm blow away by how good the first episode is, they really do capture the spirit of the game. The acting is great and there were so many nods to the fans of the games. Some scenes and dialogue being almost exactly the same while also giving more backstory to things we never got to see in the game. Honestly thank you for making this game into a show. 10/10 I can't wait to see the rest."

So far the changes have not disappointed and in its own unique way still manages to lead new viewers down the same paths TLOU fans treaded all those years before.

Permalink";"I got really hyped when The Last of Us was announced to be made, especially by HBO and the partnership between Neil Druckmann and Craig Mazin.

Druckmann is the one who gave us this incredible story, developed it in the Part 2 and managed to stick to the game foundations, keeping up the pace, the range of emotions and the impact it will have on you.

First episode looks promising, all the teasers and released materials so far are heavily linked with the atmosphere of the game and I can't wait to see more!

I can link the dynamics, dialogues and the overall atmosphere with the one I've experienced in the game

I was a bit disappointed when Bella Ramsey was set for Ellie's role. I thought Kaitlyn Dever would be the perfect fit for the character - visually and from her performances, I saw her as the one for the role.

Still, time will tell if Ramsey was the right pick for it.

As someone who played both games, I found it surprising that they've added a few things to the series on top of the experience from the original games. But these surprises are good! It adds up to the story Druckmann was telling us in the games, so they are very welcome.

To all the people who hadn't played the games - sit back, enjoy the ride of emotions and events and I hope they will end it right, same way as they've started it."

It's heartbreaking from the start and builds upon the journey from the main characters. First episode is 85 minutes long,but keeps you wanting more and more. I've played the game(recently bought it again for the playstation 5)and it's a beautiful experience so I hope they keep this tight knitted and follow the game,only slightly going off track. Don't get me wrong it's nice to add extra bits to the TV series which helps build more emotion to the characters.

As for the rest of people who are new to the story, you are in for an impressively bizarre, frightening snd intense story that is driven by a very noble cause in the show's post apocalyptic setting and world. Adding to all of this is an absolutely excellent cast starring Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey as the main characters. The show will guide you through an extremely dangerous post apocalyptic America in the most surreal world imaginable. I can't wait to see what the next episodes will bring and so will you."

Rather than follow the trend of recent TV shows that spoon feed the audience scripted explanations of why a character is broken and how that justifies immoral behavior, The Last of Us simply shows us the characters life and the moments that define them. Doing so allows the audience to connect the dots. The show does not spend time justifying questionable behavior. It shows the good and the bad. The portrayal of male characters is also a refreshing return to form of the depth and complexity that made early MCU films captivating to a male audience. There is no flawless pillar of morality here folks, just real people trying to get by in a post apocalyptic zombie land who are given the opportunity to do some good."

If you can overlook the difference in appearance from video game Ellie (based upon former Ellen Page, now Elliot Page) to tv show Ellie without thinking of Game of thrones and Lady Lyanna of the house of Mormont or missing baby Yoda, then you are about to enjoy the joyride.

Perfectly detailed, so far faithful to the game, good acting, good setting and environment, it feels like we are playing the game all over again. Eager to see what's coming after this successful first episode.

Pedro Pascal delivers as usual and it's not a surprise that Bella Ramsey becomes her character in such a convincing way. She is a young promise without a doubt, but her face in no way resembles the original Ellie's. With luck her acting will be so good that we will put the other Ellie behind without effort.

If you have played the game and you are nostalgic of those many hours in the dark looking for the light, this show is for you.

If you haven't played the game but you are in the dark after the season finale of TWD lacking a decent zombie/infected/ fungus show, look for the light in this one.

If they manage to keep the audience on their toes and create good character relations, perhaps this will be with us for a few seasons. I certainly hope so."

*Based on the full first season handed to press*

""The Last of Us is the first live-action videogame adaptation able to finally break the frustrating curse, reaching the so-desired unprecedented level of excellence.

Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann construct a complex character study driven by fascinating protagonists, Joel and Ellie, exploring the grief, traumas, and tragedies of their lives through unimaginable moral dilemmas, emotionally heavy conversations, and devastating moments.

Save for rare exceptions, the episodic narrative formula is remarkably efficient, offering a panoply of intriguing characters and outstanding performances - Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey clearly stand out from the rest. A more intimate, grounded version of a post-apocalyptic world that doesn't lack gory, violent action/horror sequences. Gustavo Santaolalla's score couldn't be a better fit.

If I was already excited to venture into the video game, now I can't wait for that day to come.""

The high production values and the series' ability to pivot its storytelling keep it fresh. Don't worry if you're not a gamer, this series will hit you hard. The Last of Us transcends its origins to become an unusually affecting, at times heartbreaking, trek of terror, right up there with the early days of The Walking Dead. After years of subpar live-action adaptations of game IP, the quality, prestige trappings, and mainstream reach of HBO's acclaimed new series make it a precedent-setting tentpole for the industry. I was impressed with how seamlessly the show built and burst my expectations, over and over again.

The story has a good foundation and instead of the usual flashbacks we just get right into it. After the first 30 minutes goes by we have our basic motivations and now the story jumps ahead to present day.

There is plenty to like about Pedro and his acting and he gets a little help from his co stars. There is lots of room for improvement and it's possible that it gets better with more episodes. I like it better then The Walking Dead, but that isn't saying much, but it's along the same lines, and there could be 4-5 seasons of this is they stretch things out.

Looking forward to seeing how this develops, as there is a decent chance this house of cards could just end up going nowhere, like the From series, and aggravate all the viewers."

Pedro Pascal is great as always, I don't think I've ever been disappointed by a performance of his. This is just another W for the guy. I am of the opinion that this is already a bit, because I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen.

And even then I was marveling at how well it was made, written, voice acted, etc. And now it being nearly 10 years later, I expected your run of the mill video game adaptation. This was not the case at all. Usually when you go into these things, you're expecting a lot of change with lore and source material etc. I was truly amazed with how much it stayed faithful to the original game. You could say it is just a copy of the 2013 game which won over 200 game of the year awards. But it's really not. It simultaneously manages to be its own while leaving in just the right amount of callbacks in. Yes, even with the cinematography there's tributes and almost shot-for-shot recreations. But I don't think this show will ever defecit from that. Only benefit. And it will only go up from here. If you're looking for a good post-apocalyptic show to watch, and you're not a fan of the original material, watch it. If you're a fan of the game and you're wanting to see it done justice, watch it. Watch this show. Regardless. You will not regret it."

They've added enough extra that weren't from the game to give the story and characters that little bit more depth but at the same time staying absolutely true to the original storyline. They've even kept a lot of the original dialogue from the game too. As far as video game adaptions go, this is by far the best I have ever seen from one. Even though I already knew the plot, it still kept me extremely excited to see how it would play out. Even if you haven't played the game, I still highly recommend watching this show as it's absolutely phenomenal... perfect 10/10 for me."

Everything was ON POINT , the acting , the atmosphere , the characters , the scenes , it was like watching the game on tv.

Man , That 5 minutes gave me the chills. I could litteraly feel the tension building up i can't wait for next week. Thank you HBO."

I cannot talk on its relationship to the game, as I have not played them, but as a fan of anything post apocalyptic, this has become the new gold standard. Though the premise is comparable to other shows in its genre, (things go sideways, disease wipes most everyone out, military kinda takes over, stuff keeps going sideways between groups of people now, batteries are rare and awesome, maybe someone has immunity and is now special, etc), this show simply does it all better. Exquisite visuals, excellent pacing, strong dialogue, strong acting and characters, and a solid script to boot. I am honestly having trouble finding any faults with the show. Frustrated I have to wait until next week for the next episode."

Pedro and Belle both suit perfectly in the characters of Joel and Ellie! The first episode itself is the manifesto of the brilliance that we can expect from the rest of the episodes.

Has the perfect amount of thrills, chills and excitement with just the right amount of drama that makes it different from the other zombie movies and shows. I am super excited to watch the rest of the episodes and you will be too once you watch the first episode.

The dark, grim nature of the game is adapted so well with the right timings of flashback and present. The setup is real good too. Anybody who has played the game and loves it will not shy away from praising this thoroughly entertaining show."

You can tell that the folks at HBO REALLY didn't want to screw this up so they took some small liberties with the story (you have to flesh some stuff out. You HAVE TO) but we're careful to always circle close to the game. The landscape and many various scenes are directly pulled from the game, as anyone who's played it can see.

While it's early in the show (I typed ""game"" first, then chuckled and wrote ""show) I'm REALLY enjoying how this is all going.

Keep it up, HBO. Pull this off and you're gonna have a massive success on your hands."

Permalink";"First off, we all had our doubts and imaginative aspirations on the casting and adaptation creation when TLOU series was introduced. Even with the heavy budgeting and still in the front seat of creation Neil Druckmann, many obstacles arised. Whom would play the cold and ""heartless"" Joel Miller? When Pedro was introduced, we all knew he was an 'actor', but could he depict and foretell a story so sad and hardening like the one of Joel Miller? Pedro is phenomenal, and his own taste in what the character means to him shows in his own recreation of Joel Miller. TLOU will only get even more immersive, and fans of this beautiful series will still continue to be amazed."

Permalink";"Huge fan of the video game WOW, now i will admit that when they said they where making a movie it was very scary.

The failed resident evil series (great FX but terrible story), and a few other video game adaptation where really bad.

There are a few differences from the original game but they are great addition to the series.

So far so good i cannot wait to see where the series goes from here.

Just sad it could not be the whole series in one shot.

From the start 1968 explaining how a fungus could contaminate the whole world was simply amazing and set you up for the start of the series.

The casting is also amazing lets see where it goes from here."

Permalink";"Episode 1 was excellent. Following the original story with some smart changes that I feel have expanded on an excellent foundation. I'm open to the changes made and hope they keep within the same feel of the original even if it isn't exactly the same. If the rest of the series is as good as the first episode, then I'd say this is the best video game adaptation ever made.

The game has a lot to work from, and I feel that the way the show is holding firm to the foundation while not feeling like the same thing. If it was just a carbon copy of the game, I don't think it would have worked. The game is amazing, but it had it's downfalls. I've been waiting for this show for ten years, and I hope it's heading in a good direction.

Update: It stuck the landing for season 1. Absolute masterclass of an adaptation and as a standalone show. Bella Ramsey deserves to be nominated AT THE VERY LEAST for her role in this show. Pedro Pascal is at his best. I just can't believe that it actually happened. We got a Last of Us show, and it was PERFECT. Some minor changes in the plot throughout to help with flow, but the overall story was handled very well!"

Permalink";"I had hopes this would live up to the very excellent first game, but this falls a bit shy of slightly disappointing second game so far.

Normally I would withhold judgement till later as things can improve over time, but unfortunately the flaws of this show are rather baked in as actors are either good or poor, they don't tend to improve overnight.

Pedro Pascal is normally serviceable but this just isn't the role for him. At no point does he ever feel like Joel who had a quiet masculine and paternal nature. Pedro just feels scruffy. Bella is actually doing a fairly good job with her role, but simply looks nothing like her. I haven't seen casting this bad since Tom Cruise was cast as Jack Reacher.

No one else left a positive or negative impression on me but one thing has to be said.

If you haven't played the games you'll likely enjoy this more than someone who has as the ""swapping"" of actors for those of different backgrounds is a bit jarring and heavy handed. Normally I don't give a flip, but it's hard to ignore that the ""bad guys"" belong to the majority demo and the ""good guys"" are everyone else (Bella being the only exception but of course she's female).

It really takes you out of the fantasy when you can tell who's going to be bad just by their skin tone. The real world isn't like this and I wish Hollywood would get with the times."

I was genually expecting a piece of garbagge, but im glad I was wrong. Great acting, awesome effects, great photography. What can I say? Im a huge fan of the game, I played the online mode everyday for 4 years, but the story mode was a piece of art. I think everyone was afraid about another game poorly adapted... gladly this wasn't the case!

I will wait a little big bit longer to judge Ellie's character. Liana Mormont seems too present in her acting? Maybe Its just my perception, but seems too confident on herself.

Anyway, Great first episode, can't wait for the rest!"

I'll tell you this much, the father and daughter moment in the beginning where Joel becomes Joel was shot for shot from the game! That moment made me cry again, it was just like the first time I saw it from the movie game cut scenes. I was speechless throughout most of the whole episode. The race swaps were fine, they didn't sell the HBO show 'The Last of Us' on that at all. So that's why I gave it a chance and it blew me away. If you are on the fence about it, fear no more. It's worth watching the first episode for sure."

Watching this show was like playing the game for the first time. The nostalgia hit, and I was in literal tears. Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey portrayed their characters flawlessly. The cinematography is incredible, and the zombies are so impressive. The music moved me to tears, feeling like I was hearing it for the first time again.

I loved how similar to the original game script it was. As soon as I saw the watch I said out loud ""I really hope she says 'Drugs. I sell hardcore drugs.'"" And when she did, I laughed out loud.

Even with the show being so close to the source material, I could definitely see how it would be really enjoyable for someone who isn't familiar with the story. It's captivating, thrilling, and downright shocking at one point. Yeah you know the part.

I can't wait to see what's in store for this show. Thank you for making such an effort to please the fans."

The sets and scenery is great I cant wait for the next episode. Ellie and joel are so well acted, i liked the intro scene that set up the whole thing. It is amazing to me how much the characters look like the game characters too. And if you have played the game and know the overall story, its still worth a watch to see it playout live action, the suspense and intensity is just great. Bella ramsey and Pedro Pascal were casted perfectly for these roles."

But it only took the first episode to convince me that these characters could work even better on film. The atmosphere was 100 percent recaptured, and the attention to detail was also spot on.

You can tell everyone involved with the production genuinely cared.

The actors chosen were perfect for their roles. And the writers staying true to the original story was absolutely the right choice. I'd expect to hear awards being discussed in the near future, and can't wait for the people behind creating this masterpiece get all the accolades they deserve.

10/10 - highly recommend."

Permalink";"Episode one does not hold a candle to the first TWD episode. The shameful decline of TWD and the end of See, leaves us bereft of exciting anarchistic worlds that stir the imagination.

Still, TLoU Ep.1 maintained a constant tension and pace throughout which was good, but the setups were predictable (not good). I haven't played the game, although the episode has a distinctly rote game format (intro cinematic with an exposition dump followed by inciting tragedy). With so little to work with, the poor writers tried their best. The performances are very good, as is the set design and direction. Obviously episode one requires a bunch of exposition so I'm counting on an improvement in originality and terrifying situations to come."

It stays so true to the game and adds so much with staying true to the story! The camera work in the first 20 minutes was as if you were playing the beginning of the game. I was skeptical about the cast at first but after watching this episode all those fears went away. I'm looking forward to what the rest of this show has to offer. I'm still worried about some of the things I've seen in the trailer, like characters that are alive that should be dead, new characters we haven't seen before. Regardless if the rest of the show is anything like the first episode, this show is going to be a television masterpiece!!"

They really adapted it well. It is worked on in such a way as a TV series so that anyone can enjoy it. They changed the story issue a bit and also added some non-game scenes with the purpose of making everything clear, detailed, and we can get closer to certain characters.

All the actors played well. Before it aired, everyone feels skeptical about the actors. ""They don't look like the game, yada-yada,"" but look, there's no one complaining about it anymore.

As a fan of the game, it seems that I will be a fan of the series as well."

They have already started with the race swapping of characters but it hasn't affected the quality of the show so far. One thing is for sure, HBO better change the story once they reach the timeline from the second game or they're going to have viewership falling off fast. I won't mention any spoilers but if you played the games you know what I'm talking about. So far the pacing of the first episode was done well, and character introductions were pretty good as well even though the casting isn't spot on to the game characters. If you can get past that and if HBO maintains the series as to what this first episode is, the show will do well and will be enjoyable to watch."

I love Pedro Pascal but I wasn't expecting his portrayal to be this exact. Bella Ramsey was the perfect choice for Ellie (little miss badass that she is).

Usually when I see a tv show is based on a video game, my immediate reaction is dread. It isn't very often they do a faithful representation and it's been a shame. I wasn't expecting this to be any different. Other creators could learn a thing or two from this representation.

Now I'm waiting to see what happens to the monsters in the movie and if it carries over.

Now, here's hoping it stays this way."

The casting and emotional toll you feel in the first episode which captures the start of the first video game is very intense. They did a great job building tension and it mimicked the events of the first game so well even knowing what happened it was exciting to see it unfold without actually being in the pilot seat playing it. The setting they made for Boston and Austin felt like we were all back there seeing last of us unfold in front of us again with much better graphics. The last of us 1 had one of the best video game stories of any games I have personally played (PlayStation 1 games to current gen) so this season should be phenomenal. Really hoping the episodes After the first hold up to this level of quality and thank you for making this series happen!"

Permalink";"Created by one of the best video game developers Naughty Dog, ""The Last of Us"" video game series is critically acclaimed for its real world immersive, brutal, scientific, intense, & heartbreaking storyline paired w its great third-person perspective stealth game mechanics.

Having played the ""The Last of Us"" series, it lived up to the hype & then some, holding a place as one of my all-time favorites.

When ""The Last of Us"" HBO series was announced & previewed, I was stoked to say the least.

Knowing the characters of Joel & Ellie, I knew Pedro Pascal & Bella Ramsey were perfectly cast. After watching the 1st episode, ""When You're Lost in the Darkness"", I couldn't be more pumped! Everyone is perfectly cast, carrying incredible vibe & tone, it was intense from start to finish.

From the opening scientific reasoning scene (which is not directly from the video game), I greatly appreciate as not only an intelligent viewer but also for the immediate immersion for the millions who've never played the video game - it instantly explains the why/how & sets up the extreme intensity that follows.

To Sarah waking up at 2:16am, thru the chaos, then ultimately, to the heartbreak (which is all directly shot from the video game) - It's everything a post apocalyptic moving picture should strive for & I seriously cannot wait. For. Each. Upcoming. Episode."

I knew the story from the game, so I did view with some expectations. Those expectations have been fulfilled and it seems like this is going to be a pretty faithful adaptation to the video game in a way that actually expands the story beyond the game. In my view, this is generally what's necessary for good video game movie adaptations.

I'm definitely going to keep watching, and I'm gonna go out on a limb and say I think HBO has a winner here."
